As we reported in March, Google is working on a new way to discover apps and games for Chromebooks in a project it\u0026#8217;s dubbed \u0026#8220;App Mall.\u0026#8221; Details were scant at the time, but we predicted that it would serve as a unified home for apps built for the web, Android, Linux, and more. This afternoon, the folks at Chrome Unboxed spotted that the new feature is available on ChromeOS today if you enable a special flag (shared at the bottom of this post). However, Google built the ChromeOS App Mall as a traditional web app, meaning you can try it for yourself on any device. Currently, the storefront is divided into three main sections \u2013 Home, Apps, and Games \u2013 as well as a search function. On the homepage, you\u0026#8217;ll find two lists of featured apps and games, below which are two collections of blog-like \u0026#8220;spotlights\u0026#8221; on particular apps and games. Notably, only web and Android apps currently appear in the App Mall, though we hope this could change in the future. If all of this looks and sounds familiar, it\u0026#8217;s because it\u0026#8217;s almost identical to the existing functionality of ChromeOS\u0026#8217;s built-in Explore app. This includes the same set of apps and spotlights, right down to the same web/PWA installation dialog. For now, the main differences are in the inclusion of an \u0026#8220;Experiment\u0026#8221; label in the bottom left and a shortcut to the Play Store in the side menu. That being the case, we\u0026#8217;ll need to keep an eye on the App Mall over the coming months to see how Google differentiates it from Explore. Chrome Unboxed notes that with the associated flag enabled, the App Mall automatically appears as a dedicated shortcut pinned to the app shelf. ChromeOS App Mall Enables an app to discover and install other apps. #cros-mall What do you think of the ChromeOS App Mall so far? What would you want to see Google add to it?

It\u0026#8217;s applicable in the UK because it predates Brexit. Apple unveiled its new iPad Pro and iPad Air lineups today, alongside updates to the Apple Pencil and Magic Keyboard. For customers in the UK and other countries across Europe, however, there\u0026#8217;s a downside: Apple is no longer including a charger in the box with the new iPad Air and iPad Pro. According to product listings in the UK and other countries across Europe, iPad Pro and iPad Air sold in those regions only include a USB-C cable in the box. There is no USB-C wall plug included this time around. This is a change from the previous-generation iPad Pro and iPad Air, which did include both the USB-C cable and wall plug in the box. There\u0026#8217;s no explanation as to why Apple made this change. The iPad mini and iPad 10 sold in the UK and Europe still include a wall plug in the box. The iPad Pro and iPad Air sold outside the UK and Europe also include a charger in the box. If you have any theories on why Apple made this change, let us know down in the comments. Thanks, TJ!

The app will connect to the Disney\u002B series, Marvel\u0026#8217;s What If\u0026#8230;? Enter the Marvel story using Apple Vision Pro From Disney\u2019s announcement: Fans will be invited to step inside the Multiverse like never before and have the chance to dive into an immersive, narrative-driven and innovative story in mixed reality. Connected to the critically acclaimed Disney\u002B Original animated series What If\u2026?, Marvel.com was given a first look at the hour-long experience, diving into what fans can expect when it is released soon as a new app for Apple Vision Pro. The new app sounds like a mix of a video, a game, and an augmented reality experience. Ultimately all of this will fit into an hour-long story. It\u0026#8217;s well worth checking out the interview with the creative forces behind What If\u2026? An Immersive Story on Marvel.com. Utilizing the revolutionary spatial computing capabilities of Apple Vision Pro, What If\u2026? \u2013 An Immersive Story will deliver a technologically advanced and engaging experience to fans. They will cross between augmented and virtual reality as they live out their narrative adventure, interacting with the world around them by using their eyes and hands. Disney and Apple have long been strong partners, a history that was evident when Disney CEO Bob Iger was present at Apple\u0026#8217;s Vision Pro announcement and pledged his support for the platform. The Disney\u002B app on Vision Pro offers immersive environments for video viewing, but this project is the first that truly hits on the level of creativity and innovation Iger promised last fall. There was no release date shared for What If\u2026? An Immersive Story, but hopefully we hear more soon.

There were no major surprises to the actual iPad announcements, as they were very much in line with what we\u0026#8217;d been expecting \u0026#8230; iPad Pro We did, as expected, get a new iPad Pro with tandem OLED display, in both 11-inch and 13-inch versions. The display is of course the headline news. The Ultra Retina XDR display features state-of-the-art tandem OLED technology that uses two OLED panels and combines the light from both to provide phenomenal full-screen brightness. The new iPad Pro supports an incredible 1000 nits of full-screen brightness for SDR and HDR content, and 1600 nits peak for HDR. No other device of its kind delivers this level of extreme dynamic range. Tandem OLED technology enables sub-millisecond control over the color and luminance of each pixel, taking XDR precision further than ever. One very pleasant surprise here was the option of matte glass (what Apple calls nano-texture glass). This is a $100 upgrade, but it\u0026#8217;s still a very good option to have available. Both models did indeed get the new M4 chip \u2013 something which even the source of the rumor, Bloomberg\u0026#8217;s Mark Gurman, didn\u0026#8217;t dare describe as anything more definite than a possibility. M4 builds on the GPU architecture of M3 \u2014 the 10-core GPU includes powerful features like Dynamic Caching, and hardware-accelerated mesh shading and ray tracing, which come to iPad for the first time. Coupled with higher unified memory bandwidth, pro rendering apps like Octane will see up to 4x faster performance than M2. A new advanced Media Engine includes support for AV1 decode, providing more power-efficient playback of high-resolution video experiences from streaming services. My view for some time has been that fewer and fewer people actually need the power of the iPad Pro, and that\u0026#8217;s even more true of this model, but it\u0026#8217;s still insane how much performance Apple has squeezed into an iPad. Speaking of squeezing, the new iPad Pro is also thinner than ever \u2013 so much so that a Thunderbolt cable actually protrudes above the display! Verdict: A truly incredible achievement, but one which very few people need. The starting price also got bumped up. The cost of maxing out the 13-inch iPad Pro, together with the new Magic Keyboard and Apple Pencil Pro, now exceeds $2,700. That\u0026#8217;s more than the cost of most MacBook Pro configurations. iPad Air The new iPad Air also aligned with pre-event reporting. The big news here, of course, is the 13-inch model. For the first time, iPad buyers are no longer forced to pay for Pro features they don\u0026#8217;t need just to get a bigger screen. The 11-inch model is a relatively modest update, but also remains at the same $599 starting price, so no complaints there. There\u0026#8217;s little reason for anyone who has the previous model to upgrade, though it is good to see the front-facing camera repositioned for use in landscape orientation. Verdict: The addition of a 13-inch iPad Air is a truly fantastic addition to the iPad line-up, and helps to offset the increasingly eye-watering pricing of the Pro models. For $799, you\u0026#8217;re still getting a fantastic display even without the OLED upgrade of the Pro, and this screen size is a real joy for immersive content, as well as multi-window working. \u0026#8216;New\u0026#8217; entry-level iPad There was no new entry-level iPad as such, but Apple did drop the 9th-gen model from the line-up, and give the 10th-gen one a very welcome $100 price cut. That effectively means that the cost of entry to iPad got a slight increase to $349, but it\u0026#8217;s much better value. Verdict: This is great news, and I view it as almost as good a move as a brand new device. Magic Keyboard The new Magic Keyboard was a smaller upgrade than some reports had suggested, but the aluminum base does give it a more premium look, and it\u0026#8217;s good to see that Apple hasn\u0026#8217;t increased the price even further. The key benefits here are the function keys and larger trackpad. The bad news is that it\u0026#8217;s only compatible with the latest models (though this does include the Air, which is a nice surprise). That means that anyone who wants to take advantage of it can do so only by replacing their iPad. Verdict: A worthwhile upgrade, without a bump in price, but no backward compatibility is disappointing. Had it been iPad Pro only, that might have been more understandable given the ultra-thin design, but it\u0026#8217;s less forgivable given that it can accommodate both the new 0.2-inch thick iPad Pro 6th generation and the 0.24-inch thick iPad Air, yet not the 0.25-inch thick 5th-gen iPad Pro. Apple Pencil Pro The new Apple Pencil Pro didn\u0026#8217;t get all of the new features rumored. There are no magnetically-attached interchangeable tips, and no specific eraser feature. However, it did deliver some of the other upgrades were were expecting: the squeeze gesture and Find My support. It also gets a new Barrel Roll gesture, which may have been the source of some of the interchangeable tips confusion, as this does provide a means of switching between thinner and thicker brushes, for example. Verdict: Some worthwhile new features for sure, and the good news is no price increase over the 2nd-gen. However, it\u0026#8217;s again disappointing that there\u0026#8217;s no backward compatibility with previous iPad Pro models. Relocating the front camera \u2013 with corresponding changes to the magnetic attachment and charging \u2013 is the likely problem here. I doubt it was deliberate: Apple would likely have loved to sell a new Pencil to owners of older models. Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro Some very welcome improvements here! Live Multicam capabilities in the iPad version of FCP is a phenomenal achievement, as is stem-splitting and additional AI musicians in Logic Pro. Most exciting of all is the announcement of a new Final Cut Camera app coming soon. Bad news for Filmic and BlackMagic, whose apps will likely be Sherlocked, but probably good news for iPhone and iPad owners. Verdict: All welcome surprises here! All in, then, a very solid event.

In January the streaming service, which has long been ad-free, debuted an ad-based tier and instantly moved nearly all its users into that tier. Since then, the only way for Prime subscribers to avoid ads has been to pay an extra $3 per month. Pretty soon, that $3 option may be more compelling as Prime Video is planning to increase the number of ways users will see ads and make shopping a key component of those ads. Prime Video to increase ads and promote shopping From Scharon Harding at Ars Technica: Those who opted for Prime Video with commercials will soon see shoppable carousel ads, interactive pause ads, and interactive brand trivia ads, as Amazon calls them. Amazon said that advertisers could buy these new displays to be shown \u0026#8220;across the vast majority of content on Prime Video, wherever it\u2019s streamed.\u0026#8221; All the new ad formats allow a viewer to place advertised products in their Amazon cart. Here\u2019s what each of the three ad changes will bring: Carousel ads will play during the normal ad breaks, providing a variety of suggested items to shop for and the option to add them directly to your Amazon cart. Pause ads are a new addition, bringing advertising to the pause screen for featured products which will also include an \u2018Add to cart\u2019 button. Brand trivia ads will seek to promote ad engagement by offering incentives like Amazon shopping credits. 9to5Mac\u2019s Take Making ads more interactive to promote shopping was a natural next step for the e-commerce juggernaut. Ad-based tiers have become a norm for nearly every streaming service. But at a time when competition among streamers is so strong, it still feels like a lot of not-so-great change for Prime Video users in a short span of time. Apple TV\u002B is the one major streaming player still holding on to its ad-free approach. As more moves like this happen, though, it will be interesting to see how much longer that approach lasts.

The inclusion of an Apple Pencil at all seems to suggest that this event could feature a refresh of the popular iPad stylus, which hasn\u0027t gotten a high-end update since 2018. There was a \u0022new\u0022 Apple Pencil last year, but it was more of a budget model \u0026mdash; its biggest change was a new USB-C charging port. 9to5Mac reported recently that the new Apple Pencil model will have a squeeze gesture, though it\u0027s not clear yet if that has anything to do with the new eraseable logo. Of course, we also expect to hear about at least four new iPads at this event too: two new iPad Pro models, and two new iPad Air models. Maybe the new Pencil will work beautifully with those.Check out our last-minute predictions regarding Apple\u0027s May 7 \u0022Let Loose\u0022 livestream.

In an appearance on The New York Times\u0027 Hard Fork podcast, Green told hosts Kevin Roose and Casey Newton that his TikTok dashboard hadn\u0027t been updated for several months and that it displays his payouts in British pounds (Green is a longtime resident of Montana).Green shared the tidbit as part of a larger conversation about how creators will weather the impending sale (or ban) of the platform. When asked if the money he\u0027s made on TikTok has changed since he posted a 2022 YouTube video about TikTok\u0027s Creator Fund, Green said, \u0022It\u0027d be nice if I knew how much money I made. I have no idea, it hasn\u0027t updated since January. It\u0027s broken. It thinks I\u0027m British.

SEE ALSO: Here\u0027s how the TikTok ban will likely play out in the courts He also added, \u0022The thing to remember about TikTok is that like it\u0027s not super together,\u0022 by which he meant that internally, TikTok cannot keep up with its rapid growth. Newton then noted how that kind of chaos may have led to the ban in the first place: If your creators aren\u0027t happy, they\u0027re not likely to organize in favor of keeping you around. And if Hank Green, one of the most prominent creators on the platform, is having trouble understanding how much the platform pays him, then it\u0027s likely that many smaller creators are struggling with similar issues in silence.

Instead, they\u0027re best spotted across a number of days around this time in May.The meteors are the debris from Halley\u0027s Comet.This is particularly famous because when observing it, astronomers realised for the first time comets could pass through the solar system multiple times.

There is now so much clean power that global fossil fuel power generation is about to fall, along with its emissions.

But there are concerns many countries are being held up in their switch to clean power because they cannot access the cash needed to fund it.Last year\u0027s renewable power \u0022milestone\u0022 was driven by yet another booming year for wind and especially solar.China, Brazil and the Netherlands led the way in terms of fast roll-outs, thinktank Ember said in its annual Global Electricity Review. China alone accounted for 51% of new solar generation and 60% of new wind, even as it continued to build vast amounts of new coal power too.Christiana Figueres, former United Nations climate chief, called 2023 a \u0022critical turning point\u0022.

Advertisement In the last two decades, solar and wind have defied expectations and grown far faster than expected, surging from just 0.2% of global power generation in 2000 to 13.4% in 2023.Dave Jones, Ember\u0027s head of global insights, said the huge growth was due to \u0022matured\u0022 policies and technologies and a plummet in costs.The cost of solar power halved last year despite a surge in demand, thanks to an explosion in manufacturing capacity.Meanwhile problems that had held up wind power - such as inflationary costs - began to resolve, unlocking more projects.

Alex Wilhelm 8:45 AM PDT \u2022 May 8, 2024 Comment Apple\u2019s iPad event had a lot to like. New iPads with new chips and new sizes, a new Apple Pencil, and even some software updates. If you are a big fan of Apple hardware, well, it was probably a good day. Now you can get an updated and thinner iPad Pro, if that\u2019s your jam. But while watching the event and parsing its news in the immediate aftermath I ran into a personal sticking point. While it\u2019s welcome that iPads are getting more and more powerful, their price point is challenging and even surpassing those of many computers. Which seems a little bit backwards. Here\u2019s how TechCrunch reported on the matter: It\u2019s also an expensive machine: The iPad Pro starts at $999 for the 11-inch model. The 13-inch version costs $1,299. And the iPad Pro doesn\u2019t come with a keyboard or a pencil in the box, so you often end up paying more than the price of a MacBook Air. Those prices go up by $200 if you want cellular connectivity. So if you wanted a new iPad Pro 13-inch with cellular connectivity and a keyboard you are well in excess of the base price for a Macbook Pro. You know, a full real computer with no caveats. The thing here is that Apple\u2019s chips are great, and its laptops are super lovely. I am writing to you on an M-based MacBook Pro right now, and it\u2019s gosh darn lovely. I just cannot imagine paying a similar ticket price for something that is, well, not as good as a productivity device and has a more locked-down OS to boot. I could be completely bonkers here, but the pricing and positioning for Apple\u2019s impressive new devices leaves me puzzled. Let\u2019s talk about it.

I live in Andorra and I\u2019ve kept the napkin in a safe inside a bank.\u201DAdvertisementOn Wednesday, Minguella told Catalunya Radio that the napkin had been in his office for years and that he had offered Barcelona the chance to display it in the club\u2019s museum.He claims he did not receive a response from Barcelona and that he will now ask lawyers to discover who is the legal owner of the napkin and how anyone can prove that they legally own it to put it for sale.Minguella has insisted he does not wish to profit from the napkin, but that he would prefer to see it in Barcelona\u2019s museum or that if it is sold, for the money to go to the club\u2019s foundation.GO DEEPERLionel Messi: The evolution of the greatest footballer of all timeGO DEEPER\u0027A thuggish flamingo\u0027: Why China turned on Lionel Messi(Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.Subscribe to The Athletic for in-depth coverage of your favorite players, teams, leagues and clubs.

Dan RobsonMay 7, 2024WINNIPEG \u2013 Three hours before puck drop, Greg Burnett awaited the fate of his beloved Winnipeg Jets, on the brink of elimination.The 56-year-old retired high school teacher stood in a fenced-off courtyard, just beyond a statue of the late Jets legend Dale Hawerchuk, between the glittering reflection of newly developed office towers on what used to be a vast parking lot in Winnipeg\u2019s age-worn downtown.AdvertisementBurnett felt optimistic. He calls it a glass-half-full mentality when his team is \u201Cparadoxically aligned with impending doom.\u201DHe sipped a Michelob Light as hundreds of Jets fans filled the streets around Canada Life Centre ahead of Game 5 of the team\u2019s first-round playoff series against the Colorado Avalanche, trailing 3-1.The stakes that night felt particularly high. The Jets\u2019 successful regular season (second in the NHL\u2019s Western Conference) was clouded by dwindling attendance and concerning comments made by ownership about the team\u2019s future.Winnipeg is Canada\u2019s seventh-largest city. With a population of 758,000, it is the NHL\u2019s smallest market.The prairie hub proudly leans into its reputation as a large \u201Csmall town.\u201D The region boasts a rich history in the game \u2014 and a passionate fan base.But Winnipeg is often overlooked by players. The Jets appear with great frequency on the \u201Cno-trade\u201D lists of many contracts. High-profile players like Jacob Trouba, Evander Kane and PL Dubois have all forced their way out of town. In The Athletic\u2019s anonymous player poll, Winnipeg was declared the destination that players least liked to visit on the road, with 41.24 percent of the vote.That sentiment has a galvanizing effect on the fan base.\u201CThe perception is that people want us to fail,\u201D Burnett said, adding that the Jets faithful embrace the team\u2019s underdog position.Burnett wore a white Connor Hellebuyck jersey, the team\u2019s All-Star goalie who recently signed a seven-year deal to stay in Winnipeg and was named a finalist for the Vezina Trophy. Burnett\u2019s jersey could have been any member of the current Jets roster, aside from the team\u2019s most recent trade deadline acquisitions. He has a jersey for almost every player who has played multiple seasons in Winnipeg since the team\u2019s return more than a dozen years ago. His collection includes more than 60 jerseys from two generations of the Jets.AdvertisementI first met Burnett in 2011, when he was one of the 13,500 fans who signed up for season tickets in 17 minutes when the Atlanta Thrashers moved to the Canadian Prairies, becoming the second iteration of the Jets.He gave me a tour of the basement he\u2019d dedicated to the team that left the city for Arizona in 1996, which had become central to Burnett\u2019s life. Celia Burnett relinquished the basement to her husband, knowing he needed a place to address his anger and sadness at the Jets\u2019 move to Arizona. He turned it into a shrine that includes a miniature locker room, old jerseys, game programs and memorabilia that spoke to the love and agony that comes with being a fan. The final A from the Winnipeg Arena sign above the entrance of the now demolished building sat on a landing above the basement stairs. Gillian, the youngest of the Burnetts\u2019 four daughters, helped her father show off his prized Jets possessions.Gillian was 9 then. She\u2019s grown up sitting in the family\u2019s seats \u2014 section 312, row 5 \u2014 next to her father. She is now 22 and has a Winnipeg Jets tattoo on her forearm.\u201CI got it in honor of my dad, because that\u2019s what my dad is \u2014 the Winnipeg Jets,\u201D Gillian said. \u201CIt\u2019s part of him.\u201DShe sat next to her 78-year-old grandmother, Donna, on a concrete stoop in True North Square, as a DJ pumped music into the pregame festival. Donna, who wore a white and pink Jets zip-up hoodie, also never misses a game, not because of an obsession with an on-ice product but because of what the team means to her family.In the late 1970s, Donna bought season tickets to the original Jets franchise. For a single mother, the Jets became a way for her to connect with her rambunctious 8-year-old son. They drove more than a half-hour to each game and always went out to a restaurant they considered to be fancy. At the time, it was all doable on Donna\u2019s teacher salary.\u201CWe had a wonderful time,\u201D she said. \u201CI just loved it.\u201D Greg Burnett at the entrance of his Jets shrine. (Dan Robson / The Athletic)But that \u201Cwonderful time\u201D didn\u2019t last. In 1996, the original Jets franchise left for Arizona. When the ownership group True North announced in 2011 that it was purchasing the Atlanta Thrashers and moving the team to Winnipeg, Jets love was rekindled.The NHL\u2019s return kicked off a revival so fervent that the franchise nurtured a waiting list of several thousand people willing to purchase season tickets should a seat ever open up.AdvertisementThe Canada Life Centre is the smallest arena in the NHL, with a capacity of just more than 15,000. And for years the Jets boasted constant sellouts and one of the loudest fan bases in the league.But over the past couple of seasons, the Jets have had only a handful of sellouts.And then early this season, Greg Burnett started to feel that familiar pang of dread when he saw rows of empty seats inside the Jets home rink. It was a reminder of an underlying anxiety shared by many fans old enough to remember the first time the team left town.It was just the second home game of the 2023-24 season and only 11,226 fans showed up to watch the team play the L.A. Kings, the lowest attendance Burnett said he had ever seen at a Jets game.Things didn\u2019t get much better. Aside from the smoldering ashes of the Arizona Coyotes \u2014 the former Jets franchise playing out its final days at a 5,000-seat college rink \u2014 Winnipeg had the lowest attendance in the NHL this season, averaging 13,490 fans. By percentage of rink capacity, the Jets were third worst at 89.9 percent, ahead of only the Buffalo Sabres and San Jose Sharks. In Winnipeg, it was the continuation of a downward trend that started with the NHL\u2019s first full 82-game season after the Covid-19 pandemic.The Jets\u2019 season-ticket base shrunk by 27 percent in three years, falling to under 9,500 from close to 13,000.The team\u2019s mediocre results didn\u2019t help. The Jets missed the playoffs in 2022, then lost in the first round after barely squeaking into the postseason in 2023.Last spring, True North angered fans with a poorly conceived \u201CForever Winnipeg\u201D ticket drive.\u201CSo is Winnipeg an NHL city? You better believe it,\u201D narrator Kenny Omega, a Winnipeg-born wrestling star asks over sentimental visuals of Jets highlights and smiling fans, before the background music turns abruptly somber. \u201CBut it takes all of us.\u201DAdvertisementThe campaign was widely viewed as a not-so-veiled threat, recalling painful memories of the Jets\u2019 departure.In February, concern about the franchise\u2019s future was stoked by comments Mark Chipman, True North\u2019s chairman, made in an interview with The Athletic\u2019s Chris Johnston.\u201CI wouldn\u2019t be honest with you if I didn\u2019t say, \u2018We\u2019ve got to get back to 13,000,\u2019\u201D Chipman told Johnston. \u201CThis place we find ourselves in right now, it\u2019s not going to work over the long haul.\u201DIn the upper bowl, behind the visiting goal \u2014 section 312, row 5 \u2014 Greg, Gillian and Donna took their regular seats in the sea of white. The rink filled quickly, as it had through the final stretch of the regular season when the Jets sold out six of the team\u2019s last eight games. A late-season surge helped build excitement for the playoffs. The Jets carried an eight-game winning streak into the playoffs. They drew the Colorado Avalanche in the first round, a team they hadn\u2019t lost to all season and had recently stomped 7-0.Maybe the fans just needed a reason to believe?If that hope was fleeting with the Jets trailing 3-1 in the series, you wouldn\u2019t have noticed as the Jets took the ice for warmups in Game 5. The arena buzz rose to a crescendo.Just after warmups, Celia Burnett met her family at their seats, taking a quick break from her job working at the front gate of Canada Life Centre, ushering lively fans through the ticket line at Portage Avenue.

The sold-out crowd twirled white towels and cheered at a relentless volume. Fans belted the words \u201CTrue North\u201D in unison when the Canadian national anthem lyrics were sung \u2014 a tradition that started with the team\u2019s inaugural season in 2011.AdvertisementOutside the Jets \u201Cwhiteout\u201D street party on Donald Street, next to the arena, another 5,000 fans packed as close to two massive projection screens. All wore white. Some reveled in more creative attire. Several wore full white bodysuits and white old-school goalie masks. One man wore a white beer-stained pinstripe suit. Another wore a Panda head. Jets fans packed the streets around the Canada Life Centre for Game 5.

The city wouldn\u2019t be the same without them.\u201DBenny, the original Jets mascot, interrupted the conversation and got down on a furry blue knee in front of Chubaty.The Bloodworth family stood quietly amid the crowd of mostly twentysomethings, reflecting both the older and younger generation of fans.

They play minor hockey for the River East Royals and catch every Jets game they can stay awake for.\u201CIt\u2019s become a part of this city\u2019s culture, for sure,\u201D Shayne said. \u201CIt\u2019s brought a lot of people together.\u201DMoments later, the street erupted as Josh Morrissey scored for the Jets halfway through the second period, tying the game at two. But before the period was over, Colorado was ahead again.Greg Burnett admitted that his optimism was fading. The Jets were 20 minutes away from another first-round exit. Considering the empty seats of the regular season, the stakes felt especially high.\u201CI hope I\u2019m wrong,\u201D he said.So is Winnipeg an NHL city?Glen Hodgson, an Ottawa-based economist and expert in the economics of sports franchises, believes it is \u2014 but in a unique, inherently precarious way. Hodgson wrote a book on the business of sports franchises, developing a methodology with his co-author for evaluating whether a sports franchise would succeed or fail.AdvertisementAs a market, Winnipeg falls short in almost every key component. The population is too small, the per capita income is too low, and there are a dwindling number of corporations with a head office in Canada\u2019s windy city.\u201CBut then you get to the intangibles, like passion,\u201D Hodgson said. \u201CAnd Manitoba is off the chart.\u201DHodgson knows the psyche of the city\u2019s sports fans well. He grew up in Winnipeg and was a devoted follower of the CFL\u2019s Winnipeg Blue Bombers, the other franchise that holds a deeply rooted place in the region\u2019s culture and identity.For many, like Burnett, the NHL\u2019s return in 2011 was a miracle, faithfully prayed for.Nostalgia and pride alone were enough to sell the team to local fans. For more than a decade, True North was viewed as a savior.The franchise was able to operate in an \u201Cif you build it, they will come\u201D mode, Hodgson said.But after the pandemic, amid a wavering Canadian economy, high inflation, and growing dissatisfaction with rising prices, stringent policies and a perceived lack of appreciation from the organization, many fans decided to stay home. The magic faded. The season-ticket waiting list disappeared. And the franchise entered a new, critical era.Chipman later clarified his comments about the franchise\u2019s sustainability and season-ticket sales, saying he was referring to the team\u2019s ability to spend to the cap and ice a contender. Gary Bettman, the NHL commissioner, visited Winnipeg this winter and underscored his confidence in the city as an ideal hockey market \u2014 which is something he has previously said about several other cities that ended up losing NHL teams.But there is plenty of reason for Jets fans to be confident in the team\u2019s commitment to Winnipeg.The franchise\u2019s books are kept private, but Chipman has said it\u2019s never lost money since its inaugural NHL season. And there is plenty of cash underpinning it. David Thomson, one of True North\u2019s co-owners, is the richest person in Canada \u2014 and 21st richest in the world \u2014 with a net worth of $61.3 billion, according to Forbes.AdvertisementTrue North has also invested hundreds of millions into the city, revitalizing the area around Canada Life Centre with sparkling new office towers. Last year, the group announced a $500 million plan to redevelop a worn-down shopping center across the street from the arena, a healthcare and social services hub for the community.Still, Winnipeg remains a constrained market, Hodgson said. There are only so many businesses and people to commit to season tickets.Chipman has been candid about True North\u2019s missteps in taking the community of Jets fans for granted. At the same time, fans like Burnett say it\u2019s also on the community to re-up its commitment to the team. He\u2019s reached out to friends who\u2019ve let their season tickets lapse in recent years, urging them to come back.The team\u2019s future likely depends on that rekindled relationship.\u201CIf you\u2019re asking the fundamental question, is the market really big enough to sustain over time, it really depends on engaging the passion,\u201D Hodgson said.\u201CIf any city is going to make it with those limitations, it will be Winnipeg.\u201D The Jets didn\u2019t have any trouble filling the stands for Game 5 of their first-round series against the Avalanche. (David Lipnowski / Getty Images)As the Colorado Avalanche pulled away from the Jets, those passionate fans started to head for the exits.\u0026nbsp;Before the final horn sounded on a 6-3 Avalanche win, large sections of the stands sat empty. Celia watched people stream through the doors onto Portage Avenue.Gillian joined her friends who\u2019d watched from the street party, which emptied off Donald Street within minutes. Hundreds of crushed silver cans sparkled beneath the street lights.In section 312, Greg sat next to his mother, watching the teams shake hands, trying to process another lost opportunity. As the players left the ice, Greg helped Donna from her seat and carefully guided her down the steep stadium stairs.He paused for a moment in the atrium, trying to describe the dejection he knew would linger u\u200B\u200Bntil the Jets begin again. A deep playoff run would certainly have stoked deeper interest in the team across the city. But this first-round exit felt perilously familiar.Advertisement\u201CYou know, as a Winnipeger,\u201D Greg said, \u201Cit feels like we can\u2019t have nice things.\u201DDonna smiled softly. Her son extended his arm and she took it. They walked away together, disappearing among the fans left and leaving.(Illustration: Eamonn Dalton / The Athletic.

Check the ink Christopher KamraniMay 8, 2024EUGENE, Ore. \u2014 Somewhere in those 6.5 hours of perpetual pain, Dan Lanning\u2019s phone lit up. But he didn\u2019t see it. He was wincing. He was breathing deeply. Alec Turner, the artist tasked with completing the massive tattoo on the left side of Lanning\u2019s chest, saw the name on the screen, and his eyes bulged.AdvertisementThe incoming call? Phil Knight.So Turner removed the needle piercing the ribs of Oregon\u2019s gregarious football coach and deadpanned: \u201CHey, man, you should probably answer this.\u201DWhen Phil Knight calls, you stop what you\u2019re doing. Lanning sat on the table, swiped his phone screen and took a respite to talk to the founder of Nike and Oregon\u2019s most famed alumnus and donor. Lanning told Knight where he was and what he was cramming into one session.The permanent portrait of Lanning\u2019s wife, Sauphia, is sprinkled with various homages to their journey through life \u2014and football \u2014 together. \u0026nbsp; View this post on Instagram \u0026nbsp; A post shared by Alec Turner (@alecturnertattoos) Before Turner dipped the needle in ink on Jan. 4, 2023, he offered Lanning numbing cream. Lanning declined but now admits that, as the hours dragged on, he regretted that decision. He thought to himself: I\u2019m a football coach, right? I should be able to handle this.\u201CI just didn\u2019t have a big window of time,\u201D Lanning says. \u201CPain is weakness leaving the body. Let\u2019s go. Knock it out.\u201DHe had just finished his first year as head football coach at Oregon, where the Ducks won 10 games, were in the College Football Playoff conversation most of the season and had a top-10 recruiting ranking for the 2023 class. He was already hooked on life in Eugene.These were the first steps in Lanning\u2019s project to not only build Oregon into a winner his way, but to sustain it for years to come. His second season with the Ducks in 2023 was another step forward, showcased by a record-setting offense that wowed even a fan base accustomed to them.But nearly a year to the date he had his map charted in ink, the ultimate test of allegiance arose.On Jan. 10, 2024, Alabama\u2019s Nick Saban announced his retirement, rocking the college football universe. Lists of candidates to replace the seven-time national championship-winning head coach were formulated by the sport\u2019s insiders almost immediately. Most put Lanning at the epicenter of the speculation cycle.AdvertisementThe Lanning-to-Alabama conjecture lasted not even 24 hours, despite false reports that he was in Tuscaloosa interviewing to replace the legend for whom he\u2019d once worked. It ended with a close-up of Lanning, puffing smoke from a cigar, announcing that he was \u2014 as he says again and again \u2014 \u201C10 toes down\u201D in Eugene.Ask Lanning if he turned down Alabama, and he flashes a grin. \u201CWhen you\u2019re in a situation where your answer is already going to be no, people don\u2019t ask you those questions.\u201DAt Oregon, Lanning enjoys a fully guaranteed deal that pays more than $7 million a year through the 2029 season and requires a $20 million buyout to leave early, in addition to the perks of running a program with the support of Nike\u2019s deep pockets. But conventional wisdom posits that most coaches linked to the highest profile and most illustrious job in the sport would at least open up a lane for communication.Lanning, turns out, isn\u2019t all that conventional.The digital clock inside Lanning\u2019s office runs vertically on the wall to the right of his vast desk. The Ducks-green seconds tick away alongside the minutes and hours to tell Lanning how much time he has. On this visit, he would turn 38 the next day, but Lanning would rather talk about anything else.\u201CTwenty-one is the last time I celebrated a birthday,\u201D he says.So what about how, at 19, on a waiter\u2019s salary at Outback Steakhouse, he purchased a house on Elizabeth Street in Liberty, Mo., while balancing life as a Division II linebacker at William Jewell College? He had four teammates move in who helped pay the mortgage. It\u2019s been nearly 20 years since they huddled together for Nintendo 64 tournaments. If a roommate was short one month, Lanning would cover for them. But he wouldn\u2019t forget about it.Leaning forward in a chair, Lanning says, \u201CRealizing early you can create your own success with hard work is something that stuck out with me.\u201DAdvertisementTrent Figg, head coach at Division III Calvin University in Grand Rapids, Mich., is one of Lanning\u2019s former teammates and roommates. Figg says Lanning hasn\u2019t changed since he\u2019s ascended college football\u2019s coaching ladder. Figg\u2019s scouting report of his friend Dan Lanning (not head football coach Dan Lanning) is succinct: He\u2019s a social butterfly and the life of the party at all times. He loves action movies. He likes to smoke a cigar. He likes to cook steak on his own stovetop. He still wears white Nike dress socks to work every day. \u201CThat,\u201D Lanning says, \u201Cis mostly true.\u201DLanning\u2019s former roommates and former employers offer up a common theme: He carries with him a unique devotion to people who believe in him.\u201CHe\u2019s the most loyal person I\u2019ve ever been around,\u201D says Figg. \u201CLike, if you talk about why he stayed in Eugene instead of going to Alabama, he sees the value in how people have invested in him, and he fully believes in himself. He\u2019s a very confident person. And he totally believes in what he has at Oregon.\u201DIt\u2019s been over a decade since Lanning left his post as recruiting coordinator at Sam Houston State in Huntsville, Texas. Longtime head coach K.C. Keeler remembers when Lanning approached him and said he got a call from Saban to join Alabama\u2019s staff as a graduate assistant for the 2015 season. Lanning\u2019s body language was telling, Keeler says; he wasn\u2019t grinning. He felt like he was going to let Keeler down.Keeler told Lanning he had to go, because that\u2019s where he\u2019d meet someone who would eventually notice him as a future head coach.\u201CIt doesn\u2019t take you long to figure out Dan Lanning\u2019s style,\u201D Keeler says. \u201CI remember telling my wife back then, \u2018I\u2019m going to have this guy for a year.\u2019 This guy was always on a different path.\u201DThat path is forever detailed on his ribs, shown through Sauphia\u2019s portrait.The Oregon symbol on her neck features a yellow ribbon in the center, commemorating her battle with an aggressive type of bone cancer in 2016. Their three sons, Caden, Kniles and Titan, are there. There\u2019s the state of Texas outline for Sam Houston State, the Sun Devils pitchfork from Lanning\u2019s time as a graduate assistant at Arizona State, the Pitt emblem for his year with the Panthers and Alabama\u2019s signature \u201CA.\u201D There\u2019s a boomerang honoring Outback Steakhouse, where Dan and Sauphia met as co-workers. The \u201C816\u201D is the area code of Lanning\u2019s hometown in Missouri, and 33-18 is the score of Georgia\u2019s win over Alabama in the national championship after the 2021 season when he was the Bulldogs defensive coordinator.Advertisement\u201CIt definitely hurt,\u201D Lanning says.The tribute to his life\u2019s work isn\u2019t meant as an ode to himself. It\u2019s to his wife, his kids, his faith, his journey, the night shifts at Outback when he was courting Sauphia by paying for her 18th birthday dinner. It\u2019s also a reminder to Lanning that the work is just starting.\u201CThe seat I sit in now, I remember what it was like when I wasn\u2019t sitting in it,\u201D Lanning says. \u201CLoyalty to me is giving the best you got every day, 10 toes down on the job that you\u2019re responsible for and owning that and realizing success will come from that. I get to live my dream. I get to do exactly what I signed up for and what I\u2019d hoped.\u201DExisting in one\u2019s dream doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s without its constant demands. The home office where he does video calls lately doesn\u2019t have an impressive array of trophies and photos in the background; the office is his closet. It\u2019s where he can tap in when needed to talk to players, parents or recruits. And when that\u2019s done, it\u2019s done, and he\u2019s out on the couch informing his three boys the night\u2019s movie is \u201CField of Dreams\u201D or \u201CBack to the Future.\u201D\u201CIn a lot of ways in our jobs now, you\u2019re a doctor on-call,\u201D he says. \u201CSomething can happen at any moment and it requires your attention. What I think I\u2019m getting better at is making sure I take advantage of those moments when it does arise. I\u2019ve been poor at that. I\u2019ve gone through basketball seasons where I got to see my son play once. That\u2019s not something I\u2019m proud of. I want to get better at it.\u201DHe may sound like how a football coach is supposed to sound when he\u2019s dissecting depth charts in media scrums, but Lanning is not a caricature of a football coach. It\u2019s helped, he says, that the stops that brought him to Oregon have meant working for Saban, Georgia\u2019s Kirby Smart, Florida State\u2019s Mike Norvell and others.\u201CGreat head coaches have to be themselves,\u201D Lanning says. \u201CIf they try and be something else, or if you do what you think everybody else is doing, then you catch yourself in a trap.\u201DAdvertisementOne avoids such traps by staying a step ahead. And Lanning, his friends and colleagues say, always has been. Since he was a 26-year-old on-campus recruiting coordinator at Arizona State, he possessed a preternatural ability to recruit.And apparently he doesn\u2019t miss when a window into his world swings open. Before Oregon\u2019s 42-6 trouncing of Colorado last September, Lanning allowed ABC cameras into the Ducks\u2019 locker room to capture a speech that went viral. Speaking of Deion Sanders\u2019 Buffaloes becoming the topic du jour of the sports world, Lanning told his team, \u201CThey\u2019re fighting for clicks, we\u2019re fighting for wins.\u201DIt was a flashpoint in the 24-hour news cycle. The payoff was a glimpse for recruits to see that what you see with Lanning is what you get. Oregon coach Dan Lanning catches raindrops on his tongue before the Ducks\u2019 game against Cal on Nov. 4, 2023. (Ali Gradischer / Getty Images)For much of the past decade, Oregon fans felt slighted, because they invested in two head coaches who vowed that Eugene was the place for them, that they\u2019d guide the Ducks to title contention, only to leave for other jobs. Willie Taggart spent one year as head coach in 2017 before leaving for Florida State. His replacement, Mario Cristobal, coached four years at Oregon and ultimately left to coach his alma mater, Miami.So imagine the level of paranoia when college football pundits listed Lanning as their guy to replace Saban. Lanning quashed it with the minute-long video. \u201CWhen good things happen, speculation occurs \u2014 and there\u2019s been a lot of good things that happened to us at Oregon,\u201D Lanning says.Before it saw the light of day on social media, on the night of Jan. 10, Lanning was on the phone with the mother of a recruit who was afraid that their decision to choose Oregon would be fleeting. She\u2019d read the headlines connecting him with the Alabama job.\u201CI said, \u2018If I made an announcement for you, would that make it clear exactly what we\u2019re going to do?\u2019\u201D Lanning recalls. \u201CThe mom said that, \u2018Yeah, that makes it really clear.\u2019 And then I told her, \u2018Hopefully at some point they\u2019ll stop asking the question.\u2019\u201DAdvertisementNew Oregon quarterback Dillon Gabriel says even though he\u2019s been on campus for only four months, Lanning\u2019s confidence in his program is infectious.\u201CHow cool is that? That\u2019s who I committed to,\u201D Gabriel says. \u201CThat coach is the guy everyone wants for the right reasons. He\u2019s great at connecting with people, he listens, he understands, he can translate that into action from a guy who\u2019s been in it for a long time. Everything he\u2019s said has come to fruition. He just keeps it real, and I think you can appreciate that. He just does the easy things at an elite level. He\u2019s mastered it. That\u2019s exactly why people want him.\u201DThe Ducks are 22-5 in two years under Lanning and have cultivated one of the sport\u2019s most explosive offenses with offensive coordinator Willie Stein calling the plays. With Heisman Trophy finalist Bo Nix at the helm last year, the Ducks ranked No. 2 in the country in total offense. Oregon\u2019s defense finished top 25 in overall team defense, too. But the undoing of the team\u2019s College Football Playoff aspirations were two agonizingly close losses to rival Washington.The Ducks now prepare for a new era as they enter the Big Ten alongside the Huskies, USC and UCLA. Asked why he thinks this year\u2019s Ducks have a shot at contending in the expanded 12-team playoff, Lanning says they\u2019ve always been aggressive in looking to increase the talent on their roster, through recruiting high school players (the Ducks ranked No. 3 in the 247Sports recruiting team composite rankings in 2024) and in the NCAA transfer portal.During the winter portal window, they added Gabriel (Oklahoma), cornerbacks Jabbar Muhammad (Washington) and Kam Alexander (UTSA), wide receiver Evan Stewart (Texas A\u0026amp;M) and former five-star recruit and UCLA QB Dante Moore. In the last week, the Ducks have further bolstered their defense with safety Peyton Woodyard (Alabama) and defensive lineman Derrick Harmon (Michigan State). Lanning staying put and believing he\u2019s in Eugene for the long term has set up Oregon for both the present and the future.\u201CDan likes to prove people wrong,\u201D Figg says. \u201CDan knows he can win a national championship at Oregon, and he wants to show the world he can do it.\u201DOregon is no longer an upstart. The Ducks made a national championship appearance, though it was nearly a decade ago in 2015. Lanning believes the program can win it all in this quaint remote town thousands of miles away from where the Southeastern Conference has reigned supreme the past two decades.Advertisement\u201CI love being part of a program that\u2019s proactive,\u201D Lanning says. \u201CThey\u2019ve always wanted a great product. This is a place where you can create that.\u201DLanning talks about making the jump from good to great. The Ducks being agonizingly close in big games has to change in the Big Ten era. Ohio State visits Oct. 12, and three weeks later, the Ducks go to The Big House to face reigning national champion Michigan on Nov. 2.With his ribs aflame with pain after being tattooed, Lanning posed for Turner so he could share the work done in one sitting on Instagram. Turner was born and raised in Eugene. For years, he has tattooed Oregon players and the \u201CO\u201D symbol on fans. Never could he have imagined Chip Kelly or Mike Bellotti walking into his shop. But in talking to Lanning, Turner says he felt like the head coach is sold on the life and pace of his hometown.Before Lanning walked out the doors, he told Turner something the artist now fully believes.\u201CHe told me he wanted to retire here,\u201D Turner says.(Illustration: Eamonn Dalton / The Athletic; photos: Tom Hauck / Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.Subscribe to The Athletic for in-depth coverage of your favorite players, teams, leagues and clubs.

The Arab world has repeatedly declared its readiness to establish relations with Israel within the context of the two-state solution. This goes back to the 2002 Arab Peace Initiative and has been reiterated in the 2023 Arab-Islamic Extraordinary Summit. On May 16, leaders of the region will gather for the 33rd Arab League Summit, where yet another plea for peace and stability will likely be made.Keep reading list of 4 itemslist 1 of 4The everyday items you never knew contained plasticlist 2 of 4UN chief urges Israel and Hamas to reach ceasefire deal in Gazalist 3 of 4Turkey seeks to join South Africa\u2019s genocide case against Israel at ICJlist 4 of 4ICJ rejects Nicaragua\u2019s request to halt German arms sales to Israelend of list The way to end the war and normalise relations in the Middle East is clear. Admit the State of Palestine to the UN, on the 1967 borders, with its capital in East Jerusalem and with control over the Muslim holy sites. Then, diplomatic relations will be established and mutual security of both Israel and Palestine will be assured. The vast majority of the world certainly agrees on the two-state solution as it is enshrined in international law and UN resolutions. Today, 142 of the 193 countries officially recognise the State of Palestine, but the United States has so far blocked Palestine\u2019s membership to the UN, where statehood really counts. Israel continues to harbour its dream \u2013 and the world\u2019s nightmare \u2013 of continued apartheid rule. Barbados, Jamaica, and Trinidad and Tobago have very recently established diplomatic relations with the State of Palestine, and the General Assembly is poised to vote an overwhelming endorsement of Palestine\u2019s membership. The unity of the global community for Palestine\u2019s political self-determination is also reflected on college campuses across the US, United Kingdom and the rest of the world. Students know the torment of apartheid and plausible genocide when they see it; and are actively demanding an end to the torment. According to Article 4 of the UN Charter, admission is effected by a decision of the General Assembly following a recommendation of the Security Council. On April 18, the Security Council\u2019s vote on Palestinian membership was vetoed by the US, but with 12 out of the 15 council members voting in favour. The UK abstained, as if it\u2019s not already made enough of a mess in the region. Because of the US veto, the General Assembly will take up the issue during an Emergency Special Session on May 10. This vote will show an overwhelming support of Palestine\u2019s membership. It will then be taken up again by the Security Council. Our point is to put UN membership upfront. Peace will never be achieved at the end of another \u201Cpeace process,\u201D as with the failed Oslo process, nor by the whims of imperial powers who have perpetually devastated the region. Israel\u2019s leaders today are dead set against the two-state solution and the US and UK have been dead set in defence of Israel\u2019s rejection of it. The US and UK have repeatedly destroyed the two-state solution by always being for it, but never just now. They have favoured endless negotiations while Israel pursues its apartheid system, a war constituting a plausible case of genocide, and illegal settlements as \u201Cfacts on the ground\u201D. In welcoming Palestine as a UN member state, the UN would also take crucial steps to ensure the security of both Israel and Palestine. Peace would be enforced by international law, and the backing of the UN Security Council, the Arab States, and indeed the world community. This moment has been more than a century in coming. In 1917, Britain declared a province of the Ottoman Empire, which did not belong to it, as the Jewish homeland. The next 30 years were wracked by violence leading to the Nakba and then to repeated wars. After the 1967 war, when Israel conquered the remaining Palestinian lands, it administered an apartheid state. Israeli society became increasingly hardened to its rule, with extremist Israelis and Palestinians on each side of the bitter divide that only widens. The US and UK have been brazenly and cynically dishonest brokers. The politics in both countries has long been Zionist to the core, meaning that both countries almost always side with Israel regardless of justice and law. We have arrived at a truly historic moment to end decades of violence. No more peace processes to be undermined by political manipulations. Peace can come through the immediate implementation of the two-state solution, with the admission of Palestine to the UN as the starting point, not the end. Diplomatic recognition should build in and invite further crucial steps for mutual security. It is time, on May 10, for all UN member states to uphold international law and vote for justice and peace.

But problems behind the scenes have meant many have not yet been found jobs. What has gone wrong?When the email of congratulations arrived in her inbox last month, Emma could not have been any more excited. Inside was meant to be the details of her first job as a junior doctor.On the brink of graduation from Warwick Medical School, the 29-year-old was due to find out about where she would working for the next two years.But despite the email being titled congratulations, next to each of her placements for her two-year foundation course, the first rung on the doctor training ladder, was the abbreviation TBC.Image caption, Emma\u0026#x27;s email did not confirm where she would be workingShe had been given what is called a placeholder job. \u0026quot;I\u0026#x27;ve been told I will have a job, but that they don\u0026#x27;t know where yet and it could take until three weeks before I am due to start in August for me to find out. All I know is it will be somewhere in the West Midlands South region.\u0026quot;It is incredibly unsettling. It makes you feel unvalued and an inconvenience. The NHS is short of doctors and yet they cannot find me a job.\u0026quot;I am renting at the moment, but depending on where I am placed I may have to give notice to my landlord and move.\u0026quot;Emma was one of more than 1,000 medical students in this position when the emails initially went out. That was nearly one in nine of those who have applied to start junior doctor training this summer.Since then the numbers have dropped to 800 as NHS trusts have created new roles and some students have already decided not to take up their place.Part of the problem is that there has been an increase in medical students this summer to start junior doctor training, with just over 9,700 accepted by the UK Foundation Programme, up from 8,655 in 2023.Some of these will have come from abroad, and under immigration rules the NHS cannot prioritise UK-trained students.The increase is welcome given the need to train more doctors, with the government in England aiming to double the number of medical student places by 2031.But it has meant NHS trusts have struggled to keep up and ensure they have enough training posts for new graduates. \u0026#x27;A lottery\u0026#x27;The British Medical Association has this week written to the health secretary to warn it is \u0026quot;exceedingly concerned\u0026quot; about the placeholder situation, after being inundated with complaints from worried medical students.Its letter says many are reporting they may only be told where they will be three weeks before their August start date, when work schedules are meant to be confirmed at least eight weeks in advance.All they know is what part of the UK they are going to be working in after being allocated to one of 18 foundation school areas in March. Some cover very large areas. There is one each for Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, while in England, one covers the whole of Yorkshire and Humber. Medical students have also had to cope with a change in the way their regions are allocated. As part of the process, they have to list each foundation school in order of preference.Previously people were allocated according to merit - with each student ranked according to how they had performed during their studies and in an application test.But this year that has changed and has been done randomly. The logic behind it was that the previous system was stressful for students and was particularly unfair on those from deprived backgrounds and ethnic minorities. They tended to perform less well, and therefore were more likely to be posted to regions they did not favour, according to the UK Foundation Programme.However, overall it has resulted in more students not ending up with one of their top five choices - more than 730 compared to just over 430 last year.Image source, Getty ImagesBMA medical students committee deputy chairman Rob Tucker says while students understood the logic behind changing the system, he feels \u0026quot;something has gone wrong\u0026quot; given what has happened. \u0026quot;Students feel like they are in a lottery. It all depends what number the computer algorithm spits out.\u0026quot;And he is worried it will lead to more people dropping out and not progressing on to the next stage of training.\u0026quot;Having more students with their bottom choices, and so many with placeholder jobs, increases the chances of more medical students walking away.\u0026quot;It\u0026#x27;s very hard if you end up in a part of the country you don\u0026#x27;t want to work [in] and then if you don\u0026#x27;t know where you are going to work in that particular region until as little as a few weeks before you start, that\u0026#x27;s not fair.\u0026quot;It costs a lot of money to train a doctor. It\u0026#x27;s good value if they work for the NHS for 30 or 40 years, but not if you lose them straight away.\u0026quot;\u0026#x27;Bottlenecks\u0026#x27;There is sympathy for their plight among those running the system.Speaking at the Royal College of Physicians annual conference last month, North London Foundation School deputy director Dr Celia Bielawski said the deaneries were working hard with NHS trusts to create the new junior doctor posts needed.\u0026quot;We have an increasing number of international medical graduates applying for foundation training every year, and the government is very keen that we should take these doctors as we need to train up additional doctors to go up through the ranks. \u0026quot;At the moment we don\u0026#x27;t have places for all of them, but we are all actively working, creating additional posts and I\u0026#x27;m confident that they will all be placed. \u0026quot;We have to get trusts to agree to take them, that\u0026#x27;s one of the fundamental issues and bottlenecks with all of this. But we\u0026#x27;ll get there, I am sure.\u0026quot; Prof Sheona Macleod, director of education and training at NHS England, is confident the situation will be resolved too, saying: \u0026quot;We will get there because we\u0026#x27;ve committed to finding them a post.\u0026quot;But she also pointed out that under the previous system, medical students could still find themselves without a job initially as some would be placed on a national reserve list after the first round of job offers.\u0026quot;We have made sure people know where they are going, as in what region, which is different to the past.\u0026quot; But she added: \u0026quot;The numbers have meant that the anxiety for the students looking at finding places hasn\u0026#x27;t gone away and we\u0026#x27;re very aware of it.\u0026quot;Additional reporting by Catherine Snowdon.Related TopicsMedicineNHSBritish Medical Association (BMA)Coronavirus Top StoriesTory MP Natalie Elphicke defects to LabourPublished3 hours agoThe inside story of Tory MP\u0026#x27;s defection to LabourPublished4 hours agoHarry and King at events two miles apart but do not meetPublished1 hour agoFeaturesCould Ofcom ban social media for under-18s?The inside story of Tory MP\u0026#x27;s defection to LabourNatalie Elphicke: who is the new Labour MP?Going to the extreme: Inside Germany\u2019s far rightOceans suffer from record-breaking year of heatJames Landale: US bomb delay is biggest warning yet for IsraelWho will compete in the Eurovision final?Japanese role-playing game joins Download FestivalTeen drama turns tables on \u0026#x27;toxic parents\u0026#x27;Elsewhere on the BBCPowerful, premium US dramaThe true story of the dealers, doctors and the billion dollar drug that fuelled America\u0026#x27;s deadly opioid addiction.AttributioniPlayerWhen do you become an adult?Lecturer Laura Tisdall explains the shifting milestones of adulthoodAttributionSoundsThe Kinsellas are back and thrivingWatch the second series of the hit crime drama exclusively on BBC iPlayerAttributioniPlayerThe surprising history of the forkFrom its controversial beginnings in Italy to a battle against bad manners in FranceAttributionSoundsMost Read1Revenge porn video like \u0026#x27;house fire\u0026#x27;, star tells MPs2US indie music giant Steve Albini dies at 613Harry and King at London events but not meeting4Woman has cyclist manslaughter conviction quashed5Tory MP Natalie Elphicke defects to Labour6Agency charging NHS nearly \u00A32,000 for nurse shift7Dine and dash couple failed to pay \u00A31,000 in bills8Forbes \u0026#x27;honoured\u0026#x27; to become deputy first minister9The inside story of Tory MP\u0026#x27;s defection to Labour10Ex-England cricketer quits George Galloway\u0026#x27;s partyBBC News ServicesOn your mobileOn smart speakersGet news alertsContact BBC NewsBest of the BBCPowerful vocals, spectacle and drama!AttributionBBC iPlayerProvocative satire with Michael SpicerAttributionBBC SoundsTony Mammoth is a man out of timeAttributionBBC iPlayerFrom the pitch to the pod...AttributionBBC SoundsHomeNewsSportWeatheriPlayerSoundsCBBCCBeebiesFoodBitesizeArtsTasterLocalThreeTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCMake an editorial complaintGet Personalised NewslettersWhy you can trust the BBC\u00A9 2024 BBC.

This surge has been partly attributed to an influx of international graduates seeking foundation positions alongside the government\u0027s drive for more healthcare professionals through initiatives like expanding student numbers by 2031.\n\nThe lack of clarity in job allocation and frequent changes have caused significant anxiety among students, leading some to question their future prospects within NHS training programs.

The SNP and Plaid Cymru are also shown in sixth and seventh place on Great Britain vote share but these parties only stand in Scotland and Wales. *Because the SNP and Plaid Cymru only campaign in Scotland and Wales respectively, the margin of error for their support across Great Britain is likely to be within \u002B/- 1% If you can\u0026#x27;t see the chart, click here.What do the latest polls tell us?With the local elections done and dusted, the next major test of voter opinion in the UK will be the general election, writes BBC senior political analyst Peter Barnes.It\u0026#x27;s hard to read across from voting in council, mayoral and police elections to what would happen in a general election. But overall the results were deeply disappointing for the Conservatives and do nothing to dispel the picture suggested by national polls.They remain stable. None of the parties has seen a significant change in their level of support since early March. Attention will turn to announcements on the economy, including growth figures and interest rates.How big are the gaps between parties?All polls are based on a sample of people interviewed, typically more than 1,000, which is then weighted to be representative of the country.There is always a margin of error, meaning the real percentage could be higher or lower than any one poll suggests.We estimate that the true support for each party lies within the ranges shown here.

All other polls were online. What is a poll tracker?Each dot in the chart shows one poll result for a party. We summarise all that information with an average line that makes it easier to understand the trend.Which polls do we use?To get an appropriate range of polls for our averages, we use those conducted by members of the British Polling Council.Its members agree to the same rules on transparency, but the council has said membership should not be seen as a guarantee of quality.The polls we include have come from BMG, Deltapoll, Find Out Now, focaldata, Ipsos, JL Partners, More in Common, Opinium, Panelbase, People Polling, Redfield and Wilton Strategies, Survation, Techne, Verian (formerly Kantar Public), WeThink (formerly Omnisis), Whitestone Insight and YouGov.We only include the headline percentages on voting intention, which pollsters calculate by excluding those people who answered \u0026quot;don\u0026#x27;t know\u0026quot; or \u0026quot;won\u0026#x27;t vote\u0026quot;.Most of the polls included cover Great Britain, although some do poll the whole of the UK. People surveyed do not get the option to choose parties which only stand in Northern Ireland.We include data that is in the public domain. Some polling companies will not publish all data for all parties at the same time.Who pays for polls?Where polling companies have stated in their data tables who their client is, we have included this in our table. It is common for polling companies to do their work for news organisations, television programmes and campaign groups. What is the margin of error?The true position for the Conservatives and Labour might be within five percentage points of our average.Nine out of 10 polls just before election day have been within that range of the eventual national vote shares in the 2010 to 2019 general elections.The gap has been smaller for other parties which campaign throughout Great Britain and smaller still for the SNP and Plaid Cymru.How do we average the polls?Our estimate of a party\u0026#x27;s support is a rolling average of polls.A party\u0026#x27;s share on any given day is the average of their results from polls taken over the previous fortnight. We only take the most recent poll from each company for that day\u0026#x27;s averages.Why do polling companies have different results?All opinion polls will differ a bit because they are interviewing different people. There are also other things that can lead to differences between polling companies. For example:Different companies find the people who take part in their polls in different waysThe precise wording of the question varies between pollsters, and some pollsters ask more than one question to reach their voting intention figuresPollsters apply \u0026quot;weights\u0026quot; to their data to try to make their results reflect the make-up of the voting population. So if a particular poll has a smaller proportion of female respondents than there are in the wider population, their responses will be given extra weight in the final results. But different companies take different factors into accountThe companies have different ways of treating people who initially say they do not know how they will vote, or are not certain if they will vote.What do pollsters ask?For voting intention, polling companies typically ask interviewees a question along the lines of: \u0026quot;If a general election were held tomorrow, which party would you vote for?\u0026quot;Some polling companies have not given their interviewees the choice of some parties, including them within the \u0026quot;other\u0026quot; category.For example, Reform UK, formerly the Brexit Party until 2021, has only been included as an option in every poll featured in our tracker since autumn 2022, while support for Plaid Cymru is included among \u0026quot;other\u0026quot; parties in polls released by Techne.Produced by Grace Richardson, Scott Jarvis, Becky Rush, Allison Shultes, Libby Rogers, Daniel Wainwright, Aidan McNamee, Jana Tauschinski, Debie Loizou, Preeti Vaghela, Robert Cuffe, John Walton.Related TopicsConservative PartyScottish GreensPlaid CymruPalace of WestminsterUK ParliamentReform UKGreen Party (England and Wales)Labour PartyLiberal DemocratsBrexit PartySNP (Scottish National Party)BBC News ServicesOn your mobileOn smart speakersGet news alertsContact BBC NewsBest of the BBCPowerful vocals, spectacle and drama!AttributionBBC iPlayerProvocative satire with Michael SpicerAttributionBBC SoundsTony Mammoth is a man out of timeAttributionBBC iPlayerFrom the pitch to the pod...AttributionBBC SoundsHomeNewsSportWeatheriPlayerSoundsCBBCCBeebiesFoodBitesizeArtsTasterLocalThreeTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCMake an editorial complaintGet Personalised NewslettersWhy you can trust the BBC\u00A9 2024 BBC.

But he confessed he was \u0026quot;not an expert on foreign policy\u0026quot; when questioned about Workers Party policies on Gaza and withdrawal from Nato.The news will be a blow to Mr Galloway, whose fledgling party is aiming to stand candidates in 500 constituencies at the general election.When contacted for comment about Mr Panesar\u0026#x27;s departure, a Workers Party spokesman said: \u0026quot;Monty has been very open in the past about his own personal struggles.\u0026quot;It is in Monty\u0026#x27;s best interests at this time to withdraw as a candidate, and we hope for his return to the field in due course.\u0026quot;Mr Galloway, who became the Workers Party\u0026#x27;s first MP in February after winning the Rochdale by-election, has said Labour was his party\u0026#x27;s \u0026quot;number one enemy because we seek to replace them\u0026quot;.He claimed last week to be in talks with Labour MPs and a Labour peer about potentially defecting to his new party, although nobody has been announced yet.Among the other Workers Party candidates, who will be expected to cover the \u00A3500 deposit for standing in a general election out of their own pocket, are former UKIP MEP Amjad Bashir, who defected to the Conservatives in 2015 and two former British ambassadors, Peter Ford and Craig Murray.More on this storyEx-England cricketer to stand for Galloway\u0026#x27;s partyPublished30 AprilWhat is the Workers Party of Britain?Published1 MarchTop StoriesTory MP Natalie Elphicke defects to LabourPublished3 hours agoThe inside story of Tory MP\u0026#x27;s defection to LabourPublished5 hours agoHarry and King at events two miles apart but do not meetPublished1 hour agoFeaturesCould Ofcom ban social media for under-18s?The inside story of Tory MP\u0026#x27;s defection to LabourNatalie Elphicke: who is the new Labour MP?Going to the extreme: Inside Germany\u2019s far rightOceans suffer from record-breaking year of heatJames Landale: US bomb delay is biggest warning yet for IsraelWho will compete in the Eurovision final?Japanese role-playing game joins Download FestivalTeen drama turns tables on \u0026#x27;toxic parents\u0026#x27;Elsewhere on the BBCPowerful, premium US dramaThe true story of the dealers, doctors and the billion dollar drug that fuelled America\u0026#x27;s deadly opioid addiction.AttributioniPlayerWhen do you become an adult?Lecturer Laura Tisdall explains the shifting milestones of adulthoodAttributionSoundsThe Kinsellas are back and thrivingWatch the second series of the hit crime drama exclusively on BBC iPlayerAttributioniPlayerThe surprising history of the forkFrom its controversial beginnings in Italy to a battle against bad manners in FranceAttributionSoundsMost Read1Revenge porn video like \u0026#x27;house fire\u0026#x27;, star tells MPs2Harry and King at London events but not meeting3US indie music giant Steve Albini dies at 614Woman has cyclist manslaughter conviction quashed5Tory MP Natalie Elphicke defects to Labour6Agency charging NHS nearly \u00A32,000 for nurse shift7Dine and dash couple failed to pay \u00A31,000 in bills8Ex-England cricketer quits George Galloway\u0026#x27;s party9Forbes \u0026#x27;honoured\u0026#x27; to become deputy first minister10The inside story of Tory MP\u0026#x27;s defection to LabourBBC News ServicesOn your mobileOn smart speakersGet news alertsContact BBC NewsBest of the BBCPowerful vocals, spectacle and drama!AttributionBBC iPlayerProvocative satire with Michael SpicerAttributionBBC SoundsTony Mammoth is a man out of timeAttributionBBC iPlayerFrom the pitch to the pod...AttributionBBC SoundsHomeNewsSportWeatheriPlayerSoundsCBBCCBeebiesFoodBitesizeArtsTasterLocalThreeTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCMake an editorial complaintGet Personalised NewslettersWhy you can trust the BBC\u00A9 2024 BBC.

Another Conservative MP giving up on the Conservatives and crossing the floor to Labour.Defections don\u0026#x27;t happen very often - or at least they don\u0026#x27;t in normal times - but barely days after former Tory minister Dan Poulter switched to Labour, Natalie Elphicke has too.Little wonder there was chat before Prime Minister\u0026#x27;s Questions began that Sir Keir Starmer wanted to talk about small boat crossings in the Channel.Natalie Elphicke is the MP for Dover.Tory MP Natalie Elphicke defects to LabourThe inside story of Tory MP\u0026#x27;s defection to LabourWho is Natalie Elphicke, the new Labour MP?When is the next general election?Defections are head-spinning for Westminster, which is a tribal place.They are a morale-lifting fillip for the party of the new arrival, and debilitating for the party the MP has left, particularly when it\u0026#x27;s from the governing to the main opposition party. Why? They personify very starkly what an opposition party is seeking to do on a far wider scale - tempt people who recently backed the Conservatives to switch to backing Labour. And the party political words of the defecting MP have an additional capacity to wound given their previous political home. \u0026quot;The elected prime minister was ousted in a coup led by the unelected Rishi Sunak. Under Rishi Sunak, the Conservatives have become a byword for incompetence and division. \u0026quot;The centre ground has been abandoned and key pledges of the 2019 manifesto have been ditched. Meanwhile the Labour Party has changed out of all recognition.\u0026quot;It\u0026#x27;s the sort of thing you wouldn\u0026#x27;t be surprised to hear from a career Labour MP.But these are the words of someone who was a Conservative MP a matter of hours ago. Tory confusionLabour will retain their existing candidate for Dover and Deal at the general election and Natalie Elphicke will stand down, we\u0026#x27;re told.But Keir Starmer will delight in the pictures of him welcoming Natalie Elphicke to his side of the House of Commons.For those in the press gallery during Prime Minister\u0026#x27;s Questions, it was quite a moment as Keir Starmer did a spot of gloating about his latest new MP.There was a bemusement and confusion from many on the Conservative benches.The news was announced only at midday and plenty of Tory MPs hadn\u0026#x27;t clocked that their former colleague was now sitting opposite them - directly behind Sir Keir and so in the camera shot when he was talking - rather than on their side. A senior Conservative source wouldn\u0026#x27;t be drawn on when the prime minister learnt he had lost another of his MPs.The source said the news \u0026quot;would be a surprise to her constituents who are on the front line of the illegal immigration issue\u0026quot;. They added that Natalie Elphicke\u0026#x27;s social media feeds were \u0026quot;a treasure trove of Labour\u0026#x27;s weaknesses\u0026quot; - the party she now sits for as an MP.

He emphasizes his belief in the power of free markets to drive innovation and growth within sustainable limits. The conversation also touches upon Fern\u00E1ndez\u0027 love for classic rock music like Rolling Stones as an expression of national identity and cultural pride rooted firmly in Argentine heritage.\n\nThe Global Story offers a nuanced perspective from Milei, presenting contrasting views on economic policy while acknowledging shared values between Argentina and the UK regarding work ethic, individual responsibility, and economic opportunity within sustainable boundaries.","ImageURL":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p0gstygv.jpg","PublisherID":2,"Business":true,"CompaniesMentioned":"INF.L (Informa),","HasJakeFlag":false},{"Title":"Richard Ashcroft: \u0027I was the mouthy lead singer\u0027","Url":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4n17q1md31o","Text":"Richard Ashcroft: \u0026#x27;I was the mouthy singer, but now I\u0026#x27;ll inspire\u0026#x27;

he says.\u0026quot;But you have to be a pioneer [and] you also have to take control over your life and your destiny.\u0026quot;He says a major step in his efforts to inspire will be two shows at Wigan Warriors\u2019 Robin Park, which have been titled simply as \u201CThe Homecoming\u201D.For Ashcroft, it will be a chance to relive memories of one of his favourite gigs with his former band.In May 1998, more than 30,000 fans thronged on to Wigan\u2019s Haigh Hall estate to witness what Ashcroft calls, in a nod to the \u201Cmythical\u201D landmark show by Stone Roses eight years earlier, \u0026quot;my own version of Spike Island\u0026quot;.\u0026quot;It was a very celebratory day for the fans and the people and the locals,\u201D he says.\u201CI was born in Billinge Hospital and when I stepped on to the stage, I turned around and I could actually see it in the distance.\u201DHe says such was the effect of the show, which came at the height of The Verve\u2019s fame in the months after Urban Hymns was released, that years later, \u201Clads in the pub were like \u2018if you see Rich, tell him nice one, because it just gave a sense of pride on that for the town\u2019\u201D.\u201CA lot of stories came from the Haigh Hall gig and it influenced a lot of people and inspired them a bit.\u201DImage caption, The singer says in the years since Haigh Hall, there have been several attempts \u0026quot;to play again in Wigan, but it\u2019s not been logistically possible\u0026quot;And it is that sense of pride he aims to bring back with his shows in July and hopes will roll into an annual series or festival that could boost Wigan\u2019s economy and give local bands a platform.\u201CI am hoping that these gigs and potentially next year\u2026 could be something that the town puts on more often and can inspire the youth to form their own bands and do their own music,\u201D he says.And it is not just local musicians he wants to inspire.\u0026quot;If we can prove that this can work, then I think Wigan is a great place for people from all over the North West to get to,\u201D he says.\u0026quot;It could be something that we could look back on and go \u2018yeah, that\u2019s where it started, that\u2019s when Wigan, for the first time in years, became a focal point for music\u2019.\u0026quot;That said he admits that the shows are not just about inspiration \u2013 they are also a celebration of his much-loved back catalogue.\u201CThe Verve haven\u2019t played or been together for years,\u201D he says.\u201CIt is an opportunity to see and hear those songs by the people who originally sung them.\u201CThere\u2019s been several attempts in that 25 years to play again in Wigan, but it\u2019s not been logistically possible.\u201CSo let\u2019s get it on, let\u2019s get it done.\u201DRichard Ashcroft: The Homecoming is at Robin Park in Wigan on 20 and 21 July.Listen to the best of BBC Radio Manchester on Sounds and follow BBC Manchester on Facebook, external, X, external and Instagram, external.

Despite his achievements, he remains grounded in his humble beginnings in Manchester\u0027s vibrant musical scene of the 1980s.\n\nAshcraft believes that quality is paramount when it comes to creating impactful art. He attributes this approach partly to the wider educational opportunities available through music education programs within GreaterManchester and the influence these experiences had on him personally, leading him to become a pioneer in his field.

The duke\u0026#x27;s spokesman said the King\u0026#x27;s \u0026quot;full programme\u0026quot; prevented any meeting.A crowd gathered in the sunshine outside St Paul\u0026#x27;s to greet Prince Harry, the driving force behind the Invictus Games, who smiled and waved from the steps as he arrived.Once inside, he gave a warm greeting to his uncle, Earl Spencer, who was sitting behind him in the cathedral.Speaking in the church where his parents were married, Prince Harry gave a Bible reading from Corinthians that emphasised different people have different gifts and strengths.Another reading from Isaiah talked of stopping \u201Cthe pointing of the finger, the speaking of evil\u201D.There was also an emotional reading of a poem about the positive impact of the Invictus Games by Michelle Turner, captain of the UK\u2019s team in Sydney in 2018.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Prince Harry meets guests and gives reading at Invictus serviceThis was clearly a very personal event for Prince Harry. With the tight-knit Invictus congregation seated in a circle, under the cathedral dome, it was almost literally his circle of trust.With the traditional hymns and prayers, the ranks of clergy, and no gimmicks or modern twists, you could imagine his grandmother the late Queen Elizabeth II fitting in comfortably with such a service.With the mellow late afternoon sunshine coming in through the long windows, it was a surprisingly intimate celebration of a decade of helping to give a sense of purpose to individuals and families under pressure.It was also shaped like a royal event, complete with cameras and cheers outside and Prince Harry shaking a few excited hands as he was leaving.

The headlines have become about who wasn\u2019t there, including his father and brother. This felt very much like a solo mission.The duke, who now lives in California, last saw the King in person shortly after his February announcement that he was being treated for an unspecified form of cancer.The King has since returned to some public duties but is continuing to receive medical care.Image source, PA MediaImage caption, The Duchess of Edinburgh also attended the Palace garden party alongside her husband and the Princess RoyalOn Wednesday he was seen removing his top hat and waving it in the air as a crowd greeted him by singing the national anthem at Buckingham Palace.Prince Harry is also not expected to meet the Prince or Princess of Wales - who is also being treated for cancer - while in the UK.On Tuesday, a spokesperson for the duke said: \u0026quot;In response to the many inquiries and continued speculation on whether or not the duke will meet with his father while in the UK this week, it unfortunately will not be possible due to His Majesty\u0026#x27;s full programme.\u0026quot;The duke of course is understanding of his father\u0026#x27;s diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon.\u0026quot;On Tuesday, the duke attended an Invictus Games summit in London, where he told delegates: \u0026quot;Sometimes you... look back and go \u0026#x27;Look at what we\u0026#x27;ve done\u0026#x27;.\u0026quot;But also given the state of the world, there is so much more to do and I think a lot of uncertainty - but what we\u0026#x27;ve created is a global community.\u0026quot;Prince Harry is not being joined by the Duchess of Sussex for this visit, but his wife is scheduled to meet him in Nigeria, where he is due to travel after his stop in London.The couple were invited by Nigeria\u0026#x27;s chief of defence staff after they met at the Invictus Games held last year in Germany.Sign up here to get the latest royal stories and analysis straight to your inbox every week with our Royal Watch newsletter.

EducationIn PicturesNewsbeatBBC VerifyDisabilityE-gate outage lessons \u0026#x27;must be learnt\u0026#x27;Image source, Getty ImagesPublished9 hours agoThe government must learn lessons from a nationwide failure of passport control e-gates at UK airports on Tuesday, a peer has warned.The technology failure, which affected major UK airports including Heathrow and Gatwick, is \u0026quot;deeply concerning\u0026quot;, Lord Foster of Bath said.A border staff union member called for better contingency planning.The Home Office said \u0026quot;at no point was border security compromised\u0026quot;.Thousands of passengers faced hours of queues on Tuesday evening after a technology failure.The BBC understands that a \u0026quot;network routing issue\u0026quot; was the cause of the outage.The glitch also affected other border security systems, according to the Immigration Services Union.In some locations staff were able to use laptops, and in others the desk systems could access a back-up database, according to Lucy Moreton, a professional officer with the union.Lord Foster, who chairs the Lords Justice and Home Affairs committee, said: \u0026quot;Technology invariably fails, but the e-gates systems have experienced a number of problems recently,\u0026quot; he said.The last major e-gate outage was around the late May bank holiday in 2023.Lord Foster called for Border Force staff to be \u0026quot;equipped and trained to deal with such situations\u0026quot;.He added that \u0026quot;resilience in our systems is essential\u0026quot; given the UK is preparing to roll out the new Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA), a permit which non-British and non-Irish citizens who do not require a visa will generally need to enter the UK.\u0026quot;The government must get the fundamentals right - and it must be prepared to learn the appropriate lessons when things go wrong,\u0026quot; Lord Foster said.Ms Moreton said this is third time there have been significant problems with e-gates in three years.Every time this has happened, the union has asked the Home Office \u0026quot;to ensure there are proper contingency plans in place\u0026quot;, she said.\u0026quot;We\u0026#x27;re assured that they are there, but then the next time the gates go down, it\u0026#x27;s evident that there just simply isn\u0026#x27;t the infrastructure, or the staff any more, to try and process people through the border while maintaining border security,\u0026quot; she said.She added that security is \u0026quot;paramount\u0026quot; and \u0026quot;that\u0026#x27;s what results in the queues\u0026quot;.\u0026quot;We can\u0026#x27;t throw the border open and just let people through without checking them,\u0026quot;

Being so adept at promoting viral videos, regardless of who makes them, is what has helped make TikTok so popular worldwide - and is what Meta is seeking to copy, especially with its rival\u0026#x27;s future in doubt, in the US at least.\u0026quot;Instagram wants to become the go-to platform for those creators if TikTok were to be banned,\u0026quot; Ms Enberg explained.US TikTok ban: When and why could the app be outlawed?\u0026#x27;Sick and tired\u0026#x27;But this is not the first time Meta has tinkered with Instagram - and there is no guarantee it will work, for creators or audiences.Katy Cowan, who runs Creative Boom - a Manchester-based platform for design creatives - told the BBC this has been \u0026quot;a kick in the teeth\u0026quot; for smaller creators.She thinks the changes may come \u0026quot;too late\u0026quot; for those frustrated by frequent platform and algorithmic changes.\u0026quot;I think people are just sick and tired of Instagram changing things,\u0026quot; she said.\u0026quot;I love Instagram and it\u0026#x27;s where I built my audience but the constant fluctuations in reach and stifled growth have made it not worth the investment in time,\u0026quot; wrote film-maker Travis Meadors on Meta\u0026#x27;s app for text posts, Threads.Under the changes in coming months, \u0026quot;aggregator\u0026quot; accounts that repeatedly post content they did not create, or make material edits to, will not be included in areas of the app where they are recommended to users, such as in Explore or Reels feeds.Instagram will also \u0026quot;reward\u0026quot; original creators by replacing a duplicate of a video with its original in recommendations where it finds multiple versions.This will not apply to content which is remixed or edited to become a meme or parody, it says.It will also apply labels attributing original creators on reposted content.\u0026quot;It takes a lot of time and effort to create original content, so those who create it should get credit and distribution even when it is reposted by other accounts,\u0026quot; Instagram said.Image source, InstagramImage caption, Instagram says creators will be notified when Reels featuring or reposting their content are replaced with their own, original content in recommendations.Meta is not the only social media firm revamping its offering in the face of TikTok\u0026#x27;s travails. Popular live-streaming platform Twitch - which is owned by Amazon - has also just rolled out its own TikTok-style short video feed to all users.The \u0026quot;Discovery Feed\u0026quot; on Twitch\u0026#x27;s mobile app will provide users with a personalised, scrollable blend of clips and live streams to \u0026quot;help viewers find content to enjoy quickly and help streamers get discovered, even when they\u2019re not live\u0026quot;.Whether these changes are what creators - and customers - actually want is less clear, says Kate Cowan.Many are now looking to other platforms such as LinkedIn for an audience.Some, she says, feel the key to reaching people in the future may even lie with approaches from the past, and a\u0026quot; humble return to traditional marketing\u0026quot; such as in-person events and meet-ups.Related TopicsSocial mediaTikTokInstagramRead moreTikTok and Universal settle music royalties disputePublished6 days agoMeta faces EU probe over Russian disinformationPublished30 AprilTikTok to take on Instagram with photo appPublished9 AprilTop StoriesTory MP Natalie Elphicke defects to LabourPublished3 hours agoThe inside story of Tory MP\u0026#x27;s defection to LabourPublished4 hours agoHarry and King at events two miles apart but do not meetPublished1 hour agoFeaturesCould Ofcom ban social media for under-18s?The inside story of Tory MP\u0026#x27;s defection to LabourNatalie Elphicke: who is the new Labour MP?Going to the extreme: Inside Germany\u2019s far rightOceans suffer from record-breaking year of heatJames Landale: US bomb delay is biggest warning yet for IsraelWho will compete in the Eurovision final?Japanese role-playing game joins Download FestivalTeen drama turns tables on \u0026#x27;toxic parents\u0026#x27;Elsewhere on the BBCPowerful, premium US dramaThe true story of the dealers, doctors and the billion dollar drug that fuelled America\u0026#x27;s deadly opioid addiction.AttributioniPlayerWhen do you become an adult?Lecturer Laura Tisdall explains the shifting milestones of adulthoodAttributionSoundsThe Kinsellas are back and thrivingWatch the second series of the hit crime drama exclusively on BBC iPlayerAttributioniPlayerThe surprising history of the forkFrom its controversial beginnings in Italy to a battle against bad manners in FranceAttributionSoundsMost Read1Revenge porn video like \u0026#x27;house fire\u0026#x27;, star tells MPs2US indie music giant Steve Albini dies at 613Harry and King at London events but not meeting4Woman has cyclist manslaughter conviction quashed5Tory MP Natalie Elphicke defects to Labour6Agency charging NHS nearly \u00A32,000 for nurse shift7Dine and dash couple failed to pay \u00A31,000 in bills8Forbes \u0026#x27;honoured\u0026#x27; to become deputy first minister9The inside story of Tory MP\u0026#x27;s defection to Labour10Ex-England cricketer quits George Galloway\u0026#x27;s partyBBC News ServicesOn your mobileOn smart speakersGet news alertsContact BBC NewsBest of the BBCPowerful vocals, spectacle and drama!AttributionBBC iPlayerProvocative satire with Michael SpicerAttributionBBC SoundsTony Mammoth is a man out of timeAttributionBBC iPlayerFrom the pitch to the pod...AttributionBBC SoundsHomeNewsSportWeatheriPlayerSoundsCBBCCBeebiesFoodBitesizeArtsTasterLocalThreeTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCMake an editorial complaintGet Personalised NewslettersWhy you can trust the BBC\u00A9 2024 BBC.

The company has faced criticism for its marketing campaigns and its workplace culture.The firm was accused by former workers in an open letter in 2021 of having a \u0026quot;culture of fear\u0026quot; within the business with \u0026quot;toxic attitudes\u0026quot; to junior staff.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, The company is known worldwide for its craft beers and IPAsIn 2022 several ex-Brewdog workers accused Mr Watt of inappropriate behaviour in a BBC Disclosure investigation.Lawyers for Mr Watt said the allegations were false. Ofcom rejected complaints that Brewdog and Mr Watt were unfairly treated by the programme.In January, Brewdog also faced a backlash after revealing it would no longer hire new staff on the real living wage, instead paying the lower legal minimum wage.Last year, the firm expanded into the Chinese market in a joint venture with brewing giant Budweiser.Brewdog\u0026#x27;s revenue grew to \u00A3321.2m in the 2022-23 financial year.Company chairman Allan Leighton said \u0026quot;few have accomplished\u0026quot; what Mr Watt has.He said: \u0026quot;I am especially pleased he will continue to offer his insight, creative genius and energy to the board.\u0026quot;Mr Watt will be replaced by James Arrow, who was hired as chief operating officer last September as forward planning for Mr Watt\u0026#x27;s replacement.He was previously managing director of Boots Opticians.Before this, he spent a decade at Dixons Carphone, where he held senior roles across e-commerce, trading, operations, sales and transformation.It\u2019s hard to imagine James Watt giving up for long on his brewing dream. Remaining on the board and as co-founder and captain, he will be a tough act for James Arrow to follow and to control.Watt\u2019s relentless energy and enthusiasm, which drove some of his staff to very strong and public criticism of his management style, is constantly sparking ideas and ambitions - for new products, for outrageous ways of promoting them, and to get the community of loyal \u0026quot;punks\u0026quot; he built up to drink his beer and invest in it.He says he wants to \u201Ccontinue to build fantastic start-ups\u201D and start new ventures of his own, as well as \u201Ccontinuing to help Brewdog build an amazing business\u201D.If he can stand back, that leaves a more conventional team and approach to growing the company\u2019s output and global portfolio of bars and hotels.They also want to get Brewdog back into profit after three years of significant losses, driven by higher energy prices, supply chain disruption and rapid expansion of its on-trade.The new chief executive, hired last year from Boots Opticians, and chairman Allan Leighton, who led Asda, the Co-operative Group and Royal Mail, will probably want to focus on preparing for a stock market float.That has been long delayed by poor market conditions, and the controversies that embattled the chief executive. Another deadline for that looms later this year, which might help explain why James Watt now has more time also for \u201Ctravelling and adventures\u201D and \u201Cspending more time with family and loved ones\u201D.Related TopicsEllonBrewDogFraserburghScotland businessAberdeenMore on this storyThe Truth about BrewDogGood Ship BrewDogAttributionSoundsTop StoriesTory MP Natalie Elphicke defects to LabourPublished3 hours agoThe inside story of Tory MP\u0026#x27;s defection to LabourPublished4 hours agoHarry and King at events two miles apart but do not meetPublished1 hour agoFeaturesCould Ofcom ban social media for under-18s?The inside story of Tory MP\u0026#x27;s defection to LabourNatalie Elphicke: who is the new Labour MP?Going to the extreme: Inside Germany\u2019s far rightOceans suffer from record-breaking year of heatJames Landale: US bomb delay is biggest warning yet for IsraelWho will compete in the Eurovision final?Japanese role-playing game joins Download FestivalTeen drama turns tables on \u0026#x27;toxic parents\u0026#x27;Elsewhere on the BBCPowerful, premium US dramaThe true story of the dealers, doctors and the billion dollar drug that fuelled America\u0026#x27;s deadly opioid addiction.AttributioniPlayerWhen do you become an adult?Lecturer Laura Tisdall explains the shifting milestones of adulthoodAttributionSoundsThe Kinsellas are back and thrivingWatch the second series of the hit crime drama exclusively on BBC iPlayerAttributioniPlayerThe surprising history of the forkFrom its controversial beginnings in Italy to a battle against bad manners in FranceAttributionSoundsMost Read1Revenge porn video like \u0026#x27;house fire\u0026#x27;, star tells MPs2US indie music giant Steve Albini dies at 613Harry and King at London events but not meeting4Woman has cyclist manslaughter conviction quashed5Tory MP Natalie Elphicke defects to Labour6Agency charging NHS nearly \u00A32,000 for nurse shift7Dine and dash couple failed to pay \u00A31,000 in bills8Forbes \u0026#x27;honoured\u0026#x27; to become deputy first minister9The inside story of Tory MP\u0026#x27;s defection to Labour10Ex-England cricketer quits George Galloway\u0026#x27;s partyBBC News ServicesOn your mobileOn smart speakersGet news alertsContact BBC NewsBest of the BBCPowerful vocals, spectacle and drama!AttributionBBC iPlayerProvocative satire with Michael SpicerAttributionBBC SoundsTony Mammoth is a man out of timeAttributionBBC iPlayerFrom the pitch to the pod...AttributionBBC SoundsHomeNewsSportWeatheriPlayerSoundsCBBCCBeebiesFoodBitesizeArtsTasterLocalThreeTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCMake an editorial complaintGet Personalised NewslettersWhy you can trust the BBC\u00A9 2024 BBC.

A protest encampment will disband at the University of California, Riverside (UCR), by midnight Friday, as university administration and protesters have reached an agreement regarding investment transparency and study abroad programs. Universities around the worldStudents at Trinity College Dublin set up an encampment on campus grounds Friday evening as part of a pro-Palestinian protest. This comes not long after college authorities imposed a $230,000 (\u20AC214,000) fine on the students union for disruption caused by previous pro-Palestinian protests. share with Facebookshare with Twittershare with emailshare link9:01 p.m. ET, May 3, 2024University of Vermont says US ambassador will no longer give commencement addressFrom CNN\u0027s Michelle Watson and Eva McKend Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the United States ambassador to the United Nations, delivers remarks at the United Nations Headquarters in New York on January 30. Fatih Aktas/Anadolu/Getty Images/FileThe US ambassador to the United Nations will no longer deliver the commencement address at the University of Vermont, according to the school\u0027s president. \u0022It is with regret that I share that our planned speaker, Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield, will not be joining us to deliver the Commencement address,\u0022 said President Suresh Garimella.Some of the protesters on the campus had called on the university to rescind its invitation to Thomas-Greenfield.Garimella didn\u0027t give a reason for the diplomat\u0027s non-attendance \u2013 but it was mentioned in a statement that focused on the demonstrations.\u0022First, I want our students to know that I see and hear you. I see you mourn for lives lost in Israel and Gaza. I hear your calls for peace and a just end to the current unrest in the region,\u0022 Garimella said. \u0022I hear your frustration with foreign policy decisions. I see your efforts to bring attention to your viewpoints and to make your city and your university safe places of which you can be proud. The voices of our community are as diverse and powerful as the issues are complex and heavy,\u0022 he added. While Garimella said he was \u0022grateful to the students and university leaders who have engaged in conversation,\u0022 he noted the demonstrations violated school policies. \u0022Those who continue to violate UVM policies do so intentionally despite having been given the opportunity to express themselves within campus rules,\u0022 Garimella said. \u0022Therefore, regrettably, appropriate student conduct processes have been initiated for those who have persistently violated university policy.\u0022 It\u0027s unclear what kind of disciplinary measures are being taken. CNN has reached out to the university for more information. share with Facebookshare with Twittershare with emailshare link11:38 p.m. ET, May 3, 2024Portland State University library \u0026quot;rendered unusable\u0026quot; after protesters took over, school president says From CNN\u0027s Veronica Miracle and Taylor RomineA protester sits near a barricade outside Millar Library on the Portland State University campus May 1 in Portland, Oregon.

The library cannot be occupied right now but the university hopes to reopen it \u0022in time for fall term,\u0022 Cudd said. The library team is working on getting remote services and finding alternative spaces for students, she added. \u0022Our entire campus community has been under a great deal of stress this week,\u0022 Cudd said. \u0022I know the campus closures were disruptive.\u0022\u0022I also know there is still much hurt and anger surrounding the protests, the ongoing violence in Gaza and the disturbing scenes that have played out in our midst. I know many of you will continue to raise your voice in protest and I am in full support of your right to do so. At the same time I expect that protesters will not intimidate and harass students or other members of our community. PSU will continue to uphold the law and our policies regarding trespassing and property damage,\u0022 she said.

Francis Chung/POLITICO/AP/FileThe group of protesters who occupied Hamilton Hall on Columbia University\u0027s campus, \u0022crossed a new line,\u0022 President Minouche Shafik said in a video message released on X Friday. Shafik called the past two weeks on campus \u0022among the most difficult in Columbia\u0027s history.\u0022\u0022The turmoil and tension, division and disruption have impacted the entire community,\u0022 Shafik said in the message, which was just over three minutes long. Columbia University students \u0022paid an especially high price,\u0022 as a result of the protests, she said. \u0022You lost your final days in the classroom and residence halls. For those of you who are seniors, you\u0027re finishing college the way you started, online,\u0022 Shafik saidThe University tried multiple times to come to resolution via dialogue, Shafik said. \u0022Academic leaders talked to students for eight days and nights,\u0022 she said. \u0022(The) University made a sincere and good offer, but it was not accepted.\u0022 While many of the protesters on campus were mostly peaceful and \u0022cared deeply,\u0022 Shafik said the group that occupied Hamilton Hall \u0022crossed a new line.\u0022 Shafik called the occupation a \u0022violent act\u0022 that affected the safety of students. \u0022Every one of us has a role to play in bringing back the values of truth and civil discourse that polarization has severely damaged. Here at Columbia, parallel realities and parallel conversations have walled us off from other perspectives,\u0022 Shafik said.Shafik said she was born in the Middle East \u0022in a Muslim family with many Jewish and Christian friends.\u0022 Through her two decades of international work Shafik said she\u0027s realized \u0022people can disagree and still make progress.\u0022 \u0022The issues that are challenging us, the Palestinian Israeli conflict, antisemitism and anti-Arab and anti-Muslim bias have existed for a long time,\u0022 Shafik said. \u0022And Columbia, despite being a remarkable institution, cannot solve them, single handedly.\u0022Shafik urged students to be an example of a better world, one in which people who disagree \u0022do so civilly.\u0022\u0022We have a lot to do, but I am committed to working at it every day and with each of you to rebuild community on our campus.\u0022 share with Facebookshare with Twittershare with emailshare link5:56 p.m. ET, May 3, 2024University of Chicago president signals school could intervene on campus encampmentFrom CNN\u2019s Joe Sutton and Brad ParksA pro-Palestinian encampment in the center of the University of Chicago campus is pictured April 30.

CIA Director Bill Burns is also taking part in talks, a source said.Meanwhile, fighting continues across Gaza. At least nine people have been killed in the latest Israeli airstrikes, according to authorities in the strip.

For most, there is simply nowhere else to go in the strip \u2014 and reoccurring Israeli strikes have put children in harm\u0027s way. A 4-year-old and 2-year-old from one family were killed by an Israeli airstrike Tuesday, and their parents were seriously injured. The family was displaced multiple times and ended up living in a tent in Rafah, according to their grandmother.\u0022This is who they are targeting. This is the \u0027safe Rafah\u0027 they talk about,\u0022 says the uncle of a 1-year-old who was killed earlier in the week, holding up the child\u0027s body.Volunteer teacher Yasmeen Abu Matar says children are experiencing a distressed mental state, have no stability and lose focus easily. \u0022We work twice as hard to try and grab their attention and help them learn,\u0022 she says from a tent school.Status of possible Israeli operation: Israeli officials briefed US officials in recent days about their latest thinking on how to evacuate civilians from Rafah, according to two sources familiar with those conversations. What was shared did not resemble a final plan and only focused on the movement of civilians out of Rafah.Watch the report below to see how children are living in Rafah (Warning: Graphic images may be disturbing for some viewers.):CNN\u0027s Paula Hancocks contributed to this report.share with Facebookshare with Twittershare with emailshare link2:10 p.m. ET, May 4, 2024Bad weather has delayed the US military\u0026#x27;s construction of a pier for aid deliveries to GazaFrom CNN\u0027s Natasha BertrandSoldiers and sailors assemble the floating pier off the shore of Gaza on April 26. US Army/APUnited States defense officials have had to pause the construction of a pier facilitating humanitarian aid deliveries to Gaza due to high winds and sea swells.The temporary pause was necessary because the weather conditions were making it unsafe for soldiers to work on the surface of the partially constructed pier, US Central Command said in a statement.Construction on the pier began last week.Construction has now moved to the Port of Ashdod, one of Israel\u2019s three main cargo ports north of Gaza, CENTCOM said. Assembly will continue there, and the system will move back to its intended location when conditions improve.CNN previously reported that as many as 1,000 US troops will be involved in the construction of the pier system known as Joint Logistics Over the Shore, or JLOTS, which \u2014 when finished and fully operational \u2014 could provide as many as 150 trucks of aid per day to the starving population in Gaza.US officials previously hoped the JLOTS system would be fully built by Friday.Once the pier system is up and running, a massive container ship called the Sagamore will be the first vessel to begin ferrying humanitarian aid from Cyprus to the pier, defense officials told CNN. The Sagamore is over 600 feet long, or nearly the length of two football fields.Humanitarian aid is desperately needed in Gaza, where a tight Israeli siege has left many of the enclave\u0027s 2.2 million people facing catastrophic levels of hunger.share with Facebookshare with Twittershare with emailshare link11:38 a.m. ET, May 4, 2024US and Israeli officials say finalizing any ceasefire deal could take daysFrom CNN\u2019s Jeremy Diamond and Kevin LiptakDestroyed structures are seen after Israeli attacks hit a refugee camp in Northern Gaza on April 26. Mahmoud Issa/Anadolu/Getty ImagesAs negotiators meet in Cairo on Saturday, US and Israeli officials say any potential agreement on a framework that would pair a temporary ceasefire with a release of hostages in Gaza would likely be followed by continued negotiations over the finer details of the deal. A final deal between the two parties is expected to take several more days to negotiate. Negotiators have made progress on the technical aspects of a potential deal, but two Israeli sources say it could take a week to finalize the deal itself.A US official echoed this point Saturday, saying even if Hamas accepts the deal as proposed, it would take several more days to hammer out some of the details that would eventually result in a truce. Those discussions could also be difficult and stretched out. American officials continue to view the talks with cautious optimism, describing progress but still mindful that previous efforts have fallen apart at the last minute.As Hamas met with mediators in Cairo on Saturday, Mossad Director David Barnea remained in Israel. But Israeli sources said he could quickly head to Egypt if Hamas agrees to the framework.CIA Director Bill Burns, who has acted as a key interlocutor for the United States in the multiparty talks, is in Cairo, a person familiar with the matter says.CNN has reached out to other mediators in the negotiations.CNN\u2019s MJ Lee, Alex Marquardt, Kareem Khadder, Mostafa Salem and Eve Brennan contributed to this report.share with Facebookshare with Twittershare with emailshare link9:02 a.m. ET, May 4, 2024What we know about the number of hostages still held in GazaFrom CNN\u2019s Larry Register, Richard Greene and Tim ListerA women looks at photos of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza, on May 1, in Tel Aviv, Israel. Amir Levy/Getty ImagesIsraeli officials believe 128 hostages taken in the October 7 attacks remain in Gaza, and that at least 34 of them are dead.The Israel Defense Forces said Friday that the remains of Elyakim Libman, who had been classified as a hostage in Gaza, were found in Israeli territory.Israel officially considers people to be hostages, even if they are dead, until their remains are returned. Not all the hostages are Israeli citizens. Eight are Thai and one is Nepali.The total number of hostages provided by Israel\u0027s military has fluctuated in the months since the attack, based on its latest intelligence.There are an additional four hostages, two of whom are dead, who have been held in Gaza since before October 7, according to the Israeli Prime Minister\u2019s Office.Hostage negotiations: A Hamas delegation has arrived in Cairo Saturday to resume hostage and ceasefire talks.The latest framework, which Israel helped craft but has not fully agreed to, calls for the release of 20 to 33 hostages over several weeks in exchange for a temporary ceasefire and the release of Palestinian prisoners. That would be followed by what sources described as the \u0022restoration of sustainable calm,\u0022 during which the remaining hostages, captive Israeli soldiers, and bodies of hostages would be exchanged for more Palestinian prisoners.share with Facebookshare with Twittershare with emailshare link8:13 a.m. ET, May 4, 2024Haunted by their colleagues\u2019 deaths: The journalists risking their lives to report on GazaFrom CNN\u0027s Antoinette Radford, Sana Noor Haq and Abdel Qadder Al-Sabbah Photo illustration by CNN/Getty Images/Alaa Abu Mohsen\u201CWhoever stays until the end, will tell the story.

After more than 200 days of fighting, Israeli bombardment has turned neighborhoods into rubble. Families have been torn apart by deaths and forced displacement; the threat of starvation looms. At the same time, 129 of the more than 250 hostages seized from Israel by Hamas remain captive in the territory, of whom at least 34 are thought to be dead.Trapped in the strip alongside their fellow Gaza residents, Palestinian reporters have become the eyes and ears of those suffering under the shadow of war. And with foreign media largely unable to enter, it is their photos, footage and reporting, often gathered at great personal risk, that have shown the world what is happening.At least 97 journalists and media workers have been killed since October \u2013 92 of whom were Palestinian \u2013 according to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ). This makes it the deadliest period for journalists since 1992, when the CPJ started collecting data.Read the full story here.share with Facebookshare with Twittershare with emailshare link7:52 a.m. ET, May 4, 2024Hamas delegation arrives in Egypt for ceasefire and hostage deal talksFrom CNN\u2019s Kareem Khadder, Mostafa Salem and Eve Brennan A smoke plume billows following Israeli bombardment north of Nuseirat, Gaza, on April 23.

Much of Hicks\u2019 testimony focused on her role in the Trump campaign in October 2016, just before Election Day. Prosecutors asked what happened when the \u201CAccess Hollywood\u201D tape came out. \u201CThe tape was damaging. This was a crisis,\u201D Hicks said. The aftermath of the tape then informed how the campaign responded when the Wall Street Journal reported on Karen McDougal\u2019s deal with American Media, Inc. not to speak about an alleged affair as part of a $150,000 agreement In the WSJ story, which also mentioned Daniels, Hicks, then a Trump campaign spokesperson, denied that Trump had had affairs with either woman. \u201CWhat I told to the Wall Street Journal is what was told to me,\u201D Hicks said of the denial she gave about the Daniels allegations. When prosecutors finished with their questions and Trump\u2019s attorney took the podium, Hicks began crying and appeared to become overwhelmed. She finished her testimony after a brief break. When cross-examining Hicks, Trump attorney Emil Bove elicited testimony that Trump was also concerned about what his wife would think. Trump asked for the newspapers not to be delivered to his residence the day the story was published, Hicks testified. Jurors hear how Trump responded to \u2018Access Hollywood\u2019 tape: Jurors saw a full transcript of the \u201CAccess Hollywood\u201D tap\uFEFFe Friday, including Trump\u2019s infamous \u201Cgrab \u2018em by the p*ssy\u201D comment, as well as other vulgar language the campaign tried to dismiss as \u201Clocker room talk.\u201D They did not, however, hear Trump on the tape, as the judge ruled the video would be prejudicial to the jury. Prosecutors are getting closer to the crime: For two weeks, prosecutors have delved deeply into the negotiations that led to hush money payments made to McDougal and Daniels before the 2016 election. But those payments are not illegal on their own. Trump is charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records stemming from how he allegedly hid the way Cohen was reimbursed for paying $130,000 to Daniels in order to keep her quiet before the 2016 election. With Hicks\u2019 testimony, prosecutors nudged closer to the repayment and the alleged charges. Attacks continue against Michael Cohen: Trump\u2019s legal team continued its trial-long assault on Michael Cohen\u2019s credibility Friday, going after everything from the way he handled his cell phones to how he would go \u201Crogue\u201D during the 2016 campaign. Link Copied! Trump paid his $9,000 fine for violating the gag order, court official says From CNN\u0026#x27;s Kara Scannell Former President Donald Trump paid his $9,000 fine on Thursday for violating the gag order in his hush money criminal trial, according to a court official. The fine was paid in two cashier\u2019s checks \u2013 one for $2,000 and one for $7,000 at the court clerk\u2019s office. Judge Juan Merchan fined Trump $9,000 this week for violating his gag order nine times. He gave him until the end of the business Friday to pay it. Merchan has yet to rule on the prosecution\u2019s allegations of four additional gag order violations by Trump, after hearing arguments Thursday morning. Link Copied! The 3rd week of Trump\u0027s hush money trial is over. Here\u0027s a timeline for what\u0027s happened so far The third week of court proceedings in Donald Trump\u2019s historic hush money criminal trial wrapped on Friday. To refresh your memory, here are the key moments and witnesses from the trial so far: April 15: Trial began with jury selection. April 19: A panel of 12 jurors and six alternates was selected. April 22: The prosecution and defense made their opening statements. Former tabloid boss David Pecker was called to testify. April 23: Judge Juan Merchan held a Sandoval hearing for Trump\u2019s alleged gag order violations, but reserved his decision. April 25: While Trump sat in the Manhattan courtroom, the Supreme Court in Washington, D.C., heard arguments on the matter of his immunity in special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s election subversion case against him. April 26: Pecker\u2019s direct questioning and cross-examination concluded. Trump\u2019s former longtime assistant Rhona Graff was called to testify briefly. Finally, Michael Cohen\u2019s former banker Gary Farro testified. April 30: Farro\u2019s testimony concluded. Prosecutors then called Dr. Robert Browning, the executive director of C-SPAN archives, and Philip Thompson who works for a court reporting company. Then, Keith Davidson, the former attorney for Daniels and McDougal, took the stand. May 2: Davidson\u2019s testimony concluded. Digital evidence analyst Douglas Daus was called to testify. May 3: After Daus finished testifying, Georgia Longstreet, a paralegal at the district attorney\u2019s office, spoke about reviewing Trump\u2019s social media posts for this case. She was followed by Hope Hicks, once a longtime Trump aide. Her highly anticipated testimony was a little less than three hours. Link Copied! Trump is also facing charges in 3 other criminal cases From CNN\u2019s Devan Cole, Amy O\u0026#x27;Kruk and Curt Merrill The hush money criminal trial against former President Donald Trump is one of four criminal cases he faces while juggling his presidential campaign. The former president faces at least 88 charges over the four criminal indictments in Georgia, New York, Washington, DC, and Florida. Trump has pleaded not guilty to every charge in these cases. Here\u2019s a recap of each case: Hush money: Trump was first indicted in March 2023 by the Manhattan district attorney on state charges related to a hush-money payment to an adult film star in 2016. Prosecutors allege Trump was part of an illegal conspiracy to undermine the integrity of the 2016 election. Further, they allege he was part of an unlawful plan to suppress negative information, including the $130,000 payment. Classified documents: Trump was indicted in June 2023 by a federal grand jury in Miami for taking classified national defense documents from the White House after he left office and resisting the government\u2019s attempts to retrieve the materials. The National Archives said in early 2022 that at least 15 boxes of White House records were recovered from the estate, including some that were classified. The charges were brought by special counsel Jack Smith. Federal election interference: Smith separately charged the former president last August with four crimes over his efforts to reverse the 2020 election results. The indictment alleges Trump and a co-conspirator \u201Cattempted to exploit the violence and chaos at the Capitol by calling lawmakers to convince them \u2026 to delay the certification\u201D of the election. That case is currently on hold as the Supreme Court weighs Trump\u2019s claims of presidential immunity in the matter. The court held a hearing on the issue of immunity in late April. Every day the court doesn\u2019t issue a decision will play into Trump\u2019s strategy of delay, jeopardizing the likelihood that Smith can bring his case to trial before the November election. Fulton County: State prosecutors in Georgia brought a similar election subversion case against Trump and others. An Atlanta-based grand jury on August 14, 2023, indicted Trump and 18 others on state charges stemming from their alleged efforts to overturn the former president\u2019s 2020 electoral defeat. A trial date has not yet been set in that case. Read more about the four criminal cases Trump faces. Link Copied! Hicks talked about the White House response to the McDougal and Daniels\u0027 stories. Catch up on what she said From CNN\u0026#x27;s Aditi Sangal Donald Trump\u2019s former close confidante Hope Hicks continued to testify after the court returned from its lunch break on Friday. Overall, she spoke for a little less than three hours and her testimony wrapped before the court adjourned for the day. Here\u2019s everything you need to know about what she said: On the Wall Street Journal story: After lunch, prosecutors resumed their questions around a November, 4, 2016, WSJ article, which reported that the National Enquirer had paid Karen McDougal for the story of her alleged affair with Trump, but had not published the story. \u201CI believe I heard Mr. Trump speaking to Mr. Cohen shortly after the story was published,\u201D Hicks testified, adding there was \u201Cnothing memorable\u201D about the call with his former attorney. She said Reince Priebus was in the car with her and Trump at the time of the call with Michael Cohen. They were traveling to a rally in Hershey, Pennsylvania, she said. Hicks read the denial she gave for the story, which said the claim of the affair was \u201Ctotally untrue.\u201D She confirmed that Trump told her to say that. She also testified about monitoring press reaction to the story and discussing it with Cohen. Trump was concerned about his wife seeing this story and the possible impact of this story on his presidential campaign, Hicks said. \u201CEverything we talked about in the context of this time period and this time frame was about whether or not there was an impact on the campaign.\u201D 2018 story about hush money to Stormy Daniels: Prosecutors showed the jury and the court the Wall Street Journal story from 2018 about the hush money payment. Hicks said she was not the White House official quoted in the story. She said Trump told her about the payment after Cohen told the New York Times that he had, in fact, made the payment without Trump\u2019s knowledge. The idea that Cohen made the $130,000 payment on his own \u201Cwould be out of character for Michael,\u201D she testified. Tearing up: Hicks started tearing up after the direct examination finished and as Trump\u2019s attorney Emil Bove took the podium. She was audibly sniffling and left the courtroom briefly. Cross-examination: When she returned to the stand, she told Bove that she felt she had Trump\u2019s \u201Ctrust and respect.\u201D She testified that Cohen tried to \u201Cinsert himself\u201D into the 2016 presidential campaign even as he \u201Cwasn\u2019t supposed to be on the campaign in any official capacity.\u201D The attorney \u201Cwasn\u2019t looped in on the day-to-day of campaign strategy,\u201D but he would go \u201Crogue\u201D and take actions that were unauthorized by Trump\u2019s team, frustrating the campaign, she added. In relation to WSJ\u2019s November 4, 2016, story, she also told the defense that Trump didn\u2019t want his family to be hurt or embarrassed by what was happening on the campaign trail. . Link Copied! What to know about Trump\u0027s legal team Donald Trump\u2019s legal team is led by Todd Blanche and Emil Bove, two former federal prosecutors from New York, and Susan Necheles, a veteran criminal defense lawyer with deep experience in New York and with appearing before Judge Juan Merchan. Here are the key things to know about Trump\u2019s legal team: Bove was the co-chief of the national security unit at the US attorney\u2019s office for the Southern District of New York. In a statement to CNN in September 2023, Blanche said that Bove is \u201Can expert in white collar and CIPA-related litigation.\u201D Blanche has worked as a prosecutor and defense attorney at two large law firms, according to his website. He says that during his career as a defense attorney, he got the criminal indictment against Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign chairman Paul Manafort dismissed prior to trial and achieved an \u201Cunexpectedly positive result in the politically charged prosecution by the SDNY against Igor Fruman, an associate of Rudy Giuliani.\u201D Fruman was sentenced to one year and one day in prison for his role in a scheme to funnel Russian money into US elections. Necheles represented Trump\u2019s business at its tax fraud trial in 2022. The company was convicted. Kendra Wharton, a white collar defense lawyer who has experience practicing in Washington, DC, was added to the former president\u2019s legal team. She is a \u201Cbrilliant lawyer\u201D and \u201Cclients have trusted her for years,\u201D Blanche said in the 2023 statement. Link Copied! Hicks testified for less than 3 hours Hope Hicks, once one of Trump\u2019s most trusted aides, testified today for a little under three hours. She was called to the stand after Georgia Longstreet, a paralegal at the district attorney\u2019s office, testified about reviewing Trump\u2019s Twitter account as well as thousands of social media posts for this case. Link Copied! Trump accused the district attorney\u0027s office of being \u0022after us for years\u0022 From CNN\u0026#x27;s Aditi Sangal The New York district attorney\u2019s office has \u201Cbeen after us for years,\u201D Donald Trump said as he left the Manhattan courtroom after the day\u2019s proceedings wrapped. \u201CThey\u2019ve destroyed people\u2019s lives,\u201D Trump added, saying people have to lawyer up and have no time left to do anything. He called it a \u201Cshame.\u201D Trump did not go into specifics, but said he \u201Cwas very interested in what took place today.\u201D After giving a political speech, Trump ended with: So, I just want to wish everybody a good weekend.\u201D Link Copied! Court is adjourned after ruling from judge Court is now adjourned, after the attorneys from each side discussed guidelines for topics that could be raised if Trump chooses to testify in his defense later in the trial. \u201CHave a good weekend,\u201D Judge Juan Merchan said, after ruling in favor of a request from Trump\u2019s legal team not to allow prosecutors to ask questions about violating the former president\u2019s gag order. Link Copied! Judge rules Trump can\u0027t be asked about his gag order violations if he decides to testify Judge Juan Merchan has ruled in favor of a defense argument that it would be too prejudicial for the jury to hear about the contempt order he issued over Donald Trump violating a gag order. He also denied the prosecution\u2019s ability to cross-examine the former president about the gag order if he chooses to testify in his defense. Prosecutors said earlier this week they wanted to ask Trump about the judge\u2019s ruling that Trump violated the gag order. Prosecutor Matthew Colangelo said asking Trump about the gag order violations was \u201Cappropriate and allowable\u201D Sandoval evidence. Merchan however said he agrees with Trump\u2019s attorney Todd Blanche and won\u2019t let the prosecutors ask about the violations. \u201CFor a jury to hear that this court \u2013 the same judge that\u2019s presiding over this case \u2013 has found Mr. Trump to be in contempt, on this case, I think would just be so prejudicial.\u201D Some context: A Sandoval hearing involves an examination of the defendant\u2019s criminal history. It is required under New York law when a defendant plans to testify in their own trial and is meant as an indicator of whether it would be a good idea for them to take the stand. Link Copied!

When she returned, Donald Trump\u2019s defense attorney Emil Bove began the cross examination. Bove\u2019s tone thus far was soft and nonconfrontational. He\u2019s ended nearly every question with \u201Cright\u201D or \u201Ccorrect,\u201D said CNN anchor and chief legal correspondent Laura Coates. However, Bove\u2019s reputation is the opposite, noted CNN\u2019s Katelyn Polantz: (H)e may be charming the jury, but his reputation from Southern District of New York (SDNY) had always been that he can come off quite harsh.

Trump\u0027s lawyer has a difficult task in cross-examining a likable witness, CNN legal analyst says From CNN\u0026#x27;s Allison Morrow By the time Trump\u2019s lawyer Emil Bove began to cross-examine Hope Hicks, one of the key witnesses brought by the prosecution, she had become visibly emotional and had teared up on the witness stand. In most trials, now would be the time for Trump\u2019s lawyers to undermine Hick\u2019s testimony to cast doubt on her credibility. But doing so now would risk turning the jury against him, one CNN legal analyst noted. \u201CCross-examining a crying witness is something that can very quickly turn a jury off of an attorney, and Emil Bove has a very delicate needle to thread here. \u201D said Elliot Williams, a former federal prosecutor. \u201CThey want to hit her hard and they want to push the points that she\u2019s made, but on a stylistic level, it\u2019s something that fraught with peril.\u201D Link Copied!

Hicks smiled and answered, \u201CI wouldn\u2019t have a job if that wasn\u2019t a regular practice.\u201D The former president exchanged a look and a smirk with his other attorney, Todd Blanche, when she said this.

Analysis: Why the Wall Street Journal story matters From CNN\u0026#x27;s Allison Morrow Prosecutors questioned former Trump staffer Hope Hicks about a Wall Street Journal story that ran four days before the 2016 election and threw the campaign into crisis. That story broke the news that the publisher of the National Enquirer agreed to pay $150,000 to former Playboy model Karen McDougal for her story about an alleged affair with Trump a decade earlier. The paper then declined to publish the story, a process known as \u201Ccatch and kill.\u201D At the time, Hicks told the Journal that the claim of the affair was \u201Ctotally untrue.\u201D Prosecutors are attempting to establish what was happening within Trump campaign headquarters in the hectic weeks before the election.

Catch up on what she has said so far A nervous Hope Hicks, Donald Trump\u2019s former campaign press secretary, took the stand and testified about her interactions with the former president, AMI chief David Pecker, and Michael Cohen before prosecutor Matthew Colangelo dove into the fallout surrounding the bombshell \u201CAccess Hollywood\u201D tape. Hicks, the prosecution\u2019s ninth witness, testified for nearly 90 minutes before the lunch break. She did not look at Trump for most of that time, glancing briefly at him during one line of inquiry about his social media behavior during the 2016 campaign, but otherwise keep her focus on the prosecutor and the jury, during her questioning. She confirmed she was testifying under subpoena. She has no professional relationship with him now. Here\u2019s what she has said so far: Trump organization is run like a family business: Hicks began testifying about the Trump Organization, which she claimed was run like a \u201Ca small family business in certain ways\u201D despite being a \u201Cbig and successful company.\u201D She added, \u201Ceverybody that works there in some sense reports to Mr. Trump,\u201D whom she referred to as such for the duration of her testimony. Hicks doesn\u2019t recall being at the Pecker-Trump meeting at Trump Tower Hicks described that Trump and Pecker were \u201Cfriends\u201D and that she was present for their phone calls. However, when asked if she was ever in and out of office when Trump was meeting with Pecker at Trump Tower she said, \u201CI don\u2019t have a recollection of that.\u201D This is important because Pecker testified that she was in and out of the August 2015 meeting at Trump Tower when the alleged conspiracy was hatched. Earlier, she had said generally it was not unusual for her to be in and out of his office during his meetings. Hicks becomes aware of \u201CAccess Hollywood\u201D tape: \u201CThis was a crisis\u201D Hicks became aware of the Access Hollywood tape on Oct 7, 2016 after receiving an email from a Washington Post reporter seeking comment, and she testified that she was concerned. She said she forwarded the email to several senior leaders of the campaign, including Jason Miller, David Bossie, Kellyanne Conway, and Steve Bannon. At a meeting with this group, she said she shared the content \u201Cverbally\u201D with Trump and had a \u201Cvague recollection\u201D of starting to read the transcript and Trump finished reading it himself. \u201CHe said that didn\u2019t sound like something he would say,\u201D Hicks testified about the tape, noting Trump asked to see the actual tape. Hicks says they were all \u201Cabsorbing the shock of it.\u201D They discussed trying to get a copy of the audio of the tape to assess the situation further. She describes Trump as \u201Cupset\u201D at the tape. She said there was consensus among the group: \u201CThe tape was damaging. This was a crisis.\u201D She described how they released a campaign statement in response, calling it \u201Clocker room banter.\u201D She also describe the onslaught of \u201Cintense\u201D media attention. Asked if Trump was concerned these reports could hurt his standing with voters, Hicks replies, \u201CYes.\u201D When Hicks first heard of Karen McDougal and Stormy Daniels Hicks says she first heard of McDougal on November 4, 2016, when contacted by the Wall Street Journal, adding she heard of Daniels one other time before Daniels was mentioned in the November 4 WSJ story. The email \u2014 displayed for the courtroom \u2014 laid out the story about AMI buying McDougal\u2019s story of an affair with Trump. The WSJ reporter asking if Trump had an affair with McDougal and was he or anyone close to him aware of or involved in the contract between McDougal and AMI. She sent the email to Jared Kushner because of his role on the campaign and also because of his relationship with Rupert Murdoch, owner of WSJ because she hoped to \u201Cbuy a little extra time.\u201D Hicks called Cohen because she knew he had a relationship with Pecker. \u201CMichael sort of feigned like he didn\u2019t know what I was talking about.\u201D She also called Pecker\u2019s office for more information. \u201CI asked what was going on, why was I receiving this email and he explained that Karen McDougal was paid for magazine covers and fitness columns and that it was all very legitimate and that was what the contract was for.\u201D Hicks sent draft responses to Cohen. The jury saw four draft responses she sent Cohen to review. Cohen responded with the draft: \u201Cinstead\u2026say: These accusations are completely untrue and just the latest despicable attempt by the liberal media and the clinton machine to distract the public from the FBI\u2019s ongoing criminal investigation into secretary clinton and her closest associates.\u201D Hicks said the reporter told her on the phone that Daniels would also be mentioned in the story about McDougal, and that when she told Trump, he wanted to know what the context was, and he wanted to ensure their was a denial of any relationship. Trump very involved in media responses throughout the campaign: \u201CIt was just me and Mr. Trump who is better than anybody at communications and branding,\u201D she said. Hicks said Trump was \u201Cvery involved\u201D in his campaign and weighed in on media responses. \u201CHe knew what he wanted to say and how he wanted to say it. We were all just following his lead. He deserves the credit for the different messages that the campaign focused on in terms of the agenda that he put forth,\u201D Hicks testified. Hicks also testified that Trump posted all of his own tweets during the campaign, or a staffer would post things Trump personally approved. Tweets that were entered into court earlier in the day were reviewed by Hicks under her testimony. This includes Trump\u2019s attacks on the late Sen. John McCain and his denial of the allegations involving women. CNN\u2019s Kristina Sgueglia contributed to this report Link Copied! Here\u0027s a timeline of key events in the hush money case that Hope Hicks has been asked about From CNN\u2019s Lauren del Valle, Kara Scannell, Annette Choi and Gillian Roberts During today\u2019s questioning of Hope Hicks, prosecutors have asked Donald Trump\u2019s former aide about how he and his inner circle reacted to the release of the \u201CAccess Hollywood\u201D tape in October 2016. This is one of several key moments that are central to the hush money case against Trump that Hicks has been asked about today. Read up on CNN\u2019s timeline of events below: August 2015: Trump meets with then-American Media Inc. CEO David Pecker at Trump Tower, prosecutors say, where Pecker agrees to be the \u201Ceyes and ears\u201D for Trump\u2019s campaign and flag any negative stories to Trump\u2019s then-fixer Michael Cohen. September 2016: Donald Trump discusses a $150,000 hush money payment understood to be for former Playboy model Karen McDougal with Michael Cohen who secretly records the conversation. McDougal has alleged she had an extramarital affair with Trump beginning in 2006, which he has denied. October 7, 2016: The Washington Post releases an \u201CAccess Hollywood\u201D video from 2005 in which Trump uses vulgar language to describe his sexual approach to women with show host Billy Bush. October 27, 2016: According to prosecutors, Cohen pays Stormy Daniels $130,000 through her attorney via a shell company in exchange for her silence about an affair she allegedly had with Trump in 2006. This $130,000 sum is separate from the $150,000 paid to McDougal. Trump has publicly denied having any affairs and has denied making the payments. November 8, 2016: Trump secures the election to become the 45th President of the United States. February 2017: Prosecutors say Cohen meets with Trump in the Oval Office to confirm how he would be reimbursed for the hush money payment Cohen fronted to Daniels. Under the plan, Cohen would send a series of false invoices requesting payment for legal services he performed pursuant to a retainer agreement and receive monthly checks for $35,000 for a total of $420,000 to cover the payment, his taxes and a bonus, prosecutors alleged. Prosecutors also allege there was never a retainer agreement. January 2018: The Wall Street Journal breaks news about the hush money payment Cohen made to Daniels in 2016. See the full timeline.

Key things to know about Hope Hicks, and her relationship with Trump, as she continues to testify From CNN\u0026#x27;s Michelle Shen Hope Hicks, once a longtime trusted aide in Donald Trump\u2019s inner circle, is testifying Friday in the New York hush money trial after being subpoenaed. \u201CI\u2019m really nervous,\u201D Hicks said while looking at the jury. She looked visibly uncomfortable after taking the stand. As CNN reported previously, Hicks appeared before the grand jury last year before Trump was indicted, as did Trump counselor Kellyanne Conway. Hicks was Trump\u2019s press secretary during the campaign and could shed light on what was happening inside the political operation in the final weeks before the 2016 election, as Cohen says he was paying off adult film star Stormy Daniels to remain quiet about an alleged affair that Trump worried could upend his presidential campaign. Trump allegedly reimbursed Cohen after he took office and has since been charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records to hide the true nature of those payments. The former president has pleaded not guilty and denied the affair. Hicks has a long shared history with Trump, starting with her time working in communications for the Trump Organization and was one of the first staffers to join his 2016 campaign. During Trump\u2019s presidency, Hicks eventually rose to become White House communication director and was one of the longest-lasting aides in a White House that was frequently marked by a series of acrimonious departures. She thrived in an environment where loyalty was paramount, consistently defending Trump amid criticism, and the president nicknamed her \u201CHopey.\u201D Hicks\u2019 proximity to Trump has at times put her under a media microscope.

Analysis: What CNN on-air analysts are saying about Hope Hicks\u2019 testimony thus far From CNN\u0026#x27;s Allison Morrow Hope Hicks, once part of the Trump inner circle, is testifying for the prosecution on the hectic time at his campaign after the \u201CAccess Hollywood\u201D tape was released in October 2016. Here\u2019s what CNN analysts have had to say about her strength as a witness in the case. Elie Honig, CNN senior legal analyst: \u201CHope Hicks was the ultimate insider\u2026If and when she says something that\u2019s helpful for the prosecution\u2019s case, it\u2019s going to hit extra hard in favor of the prosecution because you can\u2019t say this is a person who has a gripe or a beef with Donald Trump.\u201D Alyssa Farah Griffin, former Trump administration staffer: \u201CI\u2019ve actually been skeptical that Hope Hicks makes a lot of sense for the prosecution \u2026Yes, Hope is a consummate Insider. She was very close to Donald Trump, especially in the first campaign. But this is a woman who is not partisan\u2026She is fiercely loyal to Donald Trump even after January 6.\u201D Diane Kiesel, retired judge of the New York Supreme Court: \u201CHope Hicks seems to be a likable witness \u2026 It will be very interesting to see how the defense handles her on cross-examination. A woman who walks into a courtroom and says \u2018I\u2019m really nervous to be here\u2019 \u2014 I don\u2019t know that they want to go after her very harshly. That could backfire.\u201D Laura Coates, CNN chief legal analyst: \u201CThis is a very significant witness. She hasn\u2019t spoken to him in two years. He\u2019s not paying for her attorney. She\u2019s there because of a subpoena \u2026This is not somebody the jury\u2019s going to say, \u2018Well, I guess there was $130,000 being paid out that he knew nothing about.\u2019 What I\u2019m waiting to hear from her though is, what came after the campaign?

Here\u0027s what Hope Hicks said about the day of the \u0022Access Hollywood\u0022 tape release Hope Hicks, once considered one of Donald Trump\u2019s closest confidantes and most trusted aides, has been testifying about the moment the \u201CAccess Hollywood\u201D tape of Trump using crude terms to describe treatment of women was released in October 2016. Hicks recalled getting an email from a Washington Post reporter about Trump\u2019s now-infamous lewd, hot mic remarks, which threw his campaign into a panic. Hicks recalled Trump being upset when he saw the tape, and saying the comments didn\u2019t sound like him until he reviewed it directly. There was consensus in the campaign that the tape was \u201Cdamaging\u201D and that this \u201Cwas a crisis,\u201D Hicks testified. Trump was involved with the campaign response to the tape, Hicks said. She was \u201Ceventually\u201D concerned about how the tape could impact female voters\u2019 opinions, Hicks added. Remember: Prosecutors are trying to prove that the reason Trump\u2019s team paid off Stormy Daniels was in large part in order to aid his campaign.

Trump\u0027s close aide Hope Hicks is called to the stand From CNN\u0026#x27;s Kaitlan Collins Hope Hicks, once considered one of Donald Trump\u2019s closest confidantes, has been called to the stand as the prosecution\u2019s next witness. As CNN has reported previously, Hicks appeared before the grand jury last year before Trump was indicted, as did Kellyanne Conway. Hicks was Trump\u2019s press secretary during the campaign and could shed light on what was happening inside the political operation in the final weeks before the 2016 election, as Michael Cohen was paying off adult film star Stormy Daniels to remain quiet about an alleged affair that Trump worried could upend his presidential campaign. Trump reimbursed Cohen after he took office and has since been charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records. The former president has pleaded not guilty and denied the affair. Federal search warrants released in 2019 showed that prosecutors with the US attorney\u2019s office in the Southern District of New York found there was a mad scramble inside the Trump campaign to suppress additional allegations of a sexual nature from becoming public after the \u201CAccess Hollywood\u201D tape was released in the fall of 2016. At the time, Hicks called Cohen and Trump joined, according to the documents. From there Cohen, acting as a middleman, was involved in at least 10 telephone calls that day, some involving Trump and Hicks and others involving American Media Inc. executives David Pecker and Dylan Howard. AMI owns the National Enquirer tabloid. Those conversations, FBI officials believed, were apparently about Daniels, an adult film actress also known as Stephanie Clifford, according to the documents. When Hicks testified before the House Judiciary Committee shortly before the documents\u2019 release, she answered \u201Cno\u201D when asked multiple times by Democratic Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee whether she was ever present when Trump and Cohen discussed Stormy Daniels, according to a transcript released of the closed-door interview. Hicks also said she had no information about Daniels other than what she learned from reporters. Link Copied! Anticipation has been building for the testimony of former Trump aide Hope Hicks on Friday From CNN\u0026#x27;s Matt Meyer As prosecutors laid the foundation for their hush money criminal case against former President Donald Trump over the past several days, anticipation built for the appearance of a key witness: Hope Hicks, once considered one of Trump\u2019s closest confidantes and most trusted aides. Hicks was \u201Cprivy to everything\u201D long before Trump\u2019s presidential campaign was taken seriously by many in the political establishment, says CNN national correspondent Kristen Holmes. \u201CShe is somebody who you would say, \u2018knows where the bodies are buried,\u2019\u201D Holmes said. Hicks for many years served as the person who people would contact when they wanted to get access to Trump. That has given the potential of her testimony an air of deep intrigue. Thursday, the prosecution entered a large batch of text messages into evidence, including messages between ex-Trump attorney Michael Cohen and Hicks. The digital evidence also included Hicks\u2019 contact information on Cohen\u2019s phone. Legal and political observers are watching closely for how she\u2019ll further factor into proceedings.

Analysis: Trump\u0027s team is trying to discredit the use of evidence from Michael Cohen\u0027s phones From CNN\u0026#x27;s Lauren del Valle Trump\u2019s legal team signaled ahead of the hush money criminal trial that they would attack the veracity and completeness of the information on Michael Cohen\u2019s electronic devices \u2014 part of a broader strategy to chip away at the credibility of a key witness. Before the trial began, Trump\u2019s team tried to subpoena the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s employee who was responsible for the phones during the four-day lapse before delivering the devices for review by the department of Douglas Daus, the man who we\u2019ve been hearing testify. Trump\u2019s lawyers indicated in the letter they wanted to \u201Cchallenge the integrity of evidence DANY will seek to offer from Cohen\u2019s phones, for use in cross-examination of Cohen\u201D and \u201Cregarding the bias and hostility toward President Trump to attack the lack of integrity of DANY\u2019s investigation under federal constitutional.\u201D Prosecutors have sought to push back on this angle from the defense in court today. \u201CDid you see any evidence of tampering or manipulation on any of the data that you pulled related to the recording that\u2019s in evidence as people\u2019s 246?\u201D prosecutor Chris Conroy asked a short time ago. \u201CI did not,\u201D Daus testified. Remember: Cohen, Trump\u2019s former personal lawyer and \u201Cfixer,\u201D served federal prison time for actions he took while playing that role. Now he is a key prosecution witness who will testify later in the case. Several witnesses have already testified to unsavory things about Cohen, and the defense has been highlighting his past wrongdoing in hopes of chipping away at his credibility before he takes the stand.

Here\u0027s what he does and what he said yesterday From CNN\u0026#x27;s Aditi Sangal We are expecting to hear more today from Douglas Daus, who works for the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office. The prosecution called him to the witness stand on Thursday. What Daus does: He processes digital evidence in the High Technology Analysis Unit. \u201CIt\u2019s basically a way for the Manhattan DA\u2019s office to do their own analysis of electronic devices that are seized in investigations. And they have some really incredible people. As you can see from the cross-examination of this gentleman, he worked in Iraq and he\u2019s done intel work \u2014 I mean, just the most talented, incredible people work there and lend their expertise to the office to help them solve crimes,\u201D said Karen Friedman Agnifilo, the former chief assistant district attorney in the DA\u2019s office. Prosecutors used Daus, who is their seventh witness, to introduce into evidence an audio recording of a crucial phone call from September 2016 between Michael Cohen and Donald Trump. Jurors heard Cohen say on the call he needed to open a company, and that he\u2019s spoken with the Trump Organization\u2019s chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg about how to set the whole thing up. This company was to facilitate the $150,000 payment to Karen McDougal. CNN reported in 2018 on a recording of the conversation. Before court ended for the day, the defense was questioning Daus on whether he talked to anyone at the FBI about their extraction process on the phone before it was obtained by his office. There were earlier questions from defense about whether the integrity of data matters more in a criminal case because people\u2019s rights are at stake.

Judge Merchan is yet to rule on the additional alleged Trump gag order violations From CNN\u0026#x27;s Maureen Chowdhury, Jeremy Herb, Lauren del Valle and Kara Scannell Judge Juan Merchan held another gag order hearing Thursday morning to consider the prosecution\u2019s four additional allegations against former President Donald Trump in the hush money trial. Prosecutors are asking for a $1,000 maximum fine for each alleged violation, but they told Merchan they are not seeking to put Trump in jail. Trump earlier this week was fined $9,000 for nine violations of the gag order. The judge did not immediately issue a ruling Thursday. Here\u2019s what to know: Prosecutors allege several gag order violations: \u2022 Trump is impacting the fairness of the trial: \u201CHis statements are corrosive to this proceeding and the fair administration of justice,\u201D prosecutor Chris Conroy said. \u201CThe defendant is doing everything he can to make this case\u201D about politics. \u2022 Trump is aware of gag order parameters: Conroy reminded the court that Trump attorney Todd Blanche assured the judge last week that the former president \u201Cdoes, in fact, know what the gag order allows him to do and not allow him to do.\u201D \u2022 No jail request: Prosecutors told the judge they were not seeking that Trump be incarcerated for the violations. Trump\u2019s defense argues he did not violate gag order: \u2022 Trump needs to defend himself against attacks: Blanche argued that upcoming witnesses Michael Cohen and Stormy Daniels are \u201Cnot people who need to be protected.\u201D \u2022 \u201CDaring\u201D Trump to reply: \u201CCohen has been inviting and almost daring President Trump to respond to almost everything he\u2019s saying,\u201D Blanche said. He added that Daniels shouldn\u2019t be covered by the gag order either, though he acknowledged that her comments about Trump are not so \u201Cvoluminous.\u201D Merchan reiterated that the order means Trump is \u201Cnot allowed to refer\u201D to foreseeable witnesses. Read more about the gag order and yesterday\u2019s hearing. Link Copied! Here\u0027s what prosecutors have to prove From CNN\u2019s Kara Scannell and Lauren del Valle Former President Donald Trump is on trial in Manhattan for his alleged role in a hush money scheme to silence his alleged mistresses before the 2016 election. He faces 34 counts related to \u201Cfalsifying New York business records in order to conceal damaging information and unlawful activity from American voters before and after the 2016 election.\u201D Prosecutors need to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Trump falsified business records with the intent to commit or conceal another crime, but they don\u2019t have to prove that Trump committed that crime. The prosecution theory is that the second crime could be in violation of federal and state election laws or state tax laws regarding how the reimbursements to Michael Cohen were handled. Trump\u2019s attorneys have kept their defense close to the vest, but in court filings they\u2019ve indicated that they plan to attack the credibility of Cohen and Stormy Daniels and paint them as liars who are motivated by grudges and money. Trump\u2019s legal team is led by Todd Blanche and Emil Bove, two former federal prosecutors from New York, and Susan Necheles, a veteran criminal defense lawyer with deep experience in New York and before Merchan. Necheles represented Trump\u2019s business at its tax fraud trial in 2022. The company was convicted. Outside lawyers who have been following the case closely say Trump is likely to argue that hush money payments are legal and distance the former president from the repayment scheme and bookkeeping handled by his trusted employees. They may also argue the payments were made to prevent embarrassment to Trump\u2019s family and not to influence the election. Trump could also testify in his own defense. He has testified in two recent civil trials, after regretting not taking the stand in a prior civil trial, but the stakes are higher in a criminal case. Link Copied! What to know about Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal From CNN\u0026#x27;s Kaanita Iyer Former President Donald Trump has been accused of taking part in an illegal conspiracy to undermine the integrity of the 2016 election and an unlawful plan to suppress negative information, which included a hush money payment made to adult film star Stormy Daniels to hide an affair. Trump has denied the affair. Daniels, whose legal name is Stephanie Clifford, received a $130,000 payment just days before the 2016 presidential election. Prosecutors allege Trump disguised the transaction as a legal payment and falsified business records numerous times to \u201Cpromote his candidacy.\u201D Trump faces 34 counts of falsifying business records. He has pleaded not guilty. Daniels shared in a documentary released in March that she accepted the payment to keep her one-night stand with Trump in 2006 from becoming public to protect her husband and daughter. Meanwhile, Karen McDougal is a model and actress who has said she had a monthslong affair with Trump in 2006. She was paid $150,000 to keep quiet about it by the National Enquirer, according to prosecutors. Trump has denied the affair. While the hush money trial is focused on the hush money deal involving Daniels, prosecutors have used the alleged McDougal payoff as evidence the schemes were aimed at protecting Trump\u2019s electoral chances.

April 26: Pecker\u2019s direct questioning and cross-examination concluded. Trump\u2019s former longtime assistant Rhona Graff was called to testify briefly. Finally, Michael Cohen\u2019s former banker Gary Farro testified. April 30: Farro\u2019s testimony concluded. Prosecutors then called Dr. Robert Browning, the executive director of C-SPAN archives, and Philip Thompson who works for a court reporting company. Then, Keith Davidson, the former attorney for Daniels and McDougal, took the stand. May 2: Davidson\u2019s testimony concluded. Digital evidence analyst Douglas Daus was called to testify.

Key takeaways from Thursday\u0027s proceedings From CNN\u0026#x27;s Jeremy Herb, Lauren del Valle and Kara Scannell Here are the top takeaways from Thursday, which was Day 10 of Donald Trump\u2019s hush money trial: Trump lawyer drags Davidson through the celebrity mud: After prosecutors finished walking Keith Davidson meticulously through the deals he cut before the 2016 election for both Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal, Trump\u2019s attorney dragged Davidson through the proverbial celebrity mud, ticking through a host of deals he was involved with related to other high-profile figures. Emil Bove pressed Davidson on whether he had studied extortion law when he sought money from AMI and Michael Cohen for the McDougal and Daniels deals. Bove asked Davidson whether he went \u201Cright up to the line without committing extortion\u201D with the Trump deals. Without saying so specifically, the upshot from Trump\u2019s attorney was that the Trump deals followed a pattern that bordered on extortion. The upshot from Trump\u2019s attorney was that the Trump deals followed a pattern that bordered on extortion. Another gag order hearing over Trump comments: Merchan held a second hearing Thursday morning over more gag order violations prosecutors want Trump held in contempt for. Merchan did not rule on the latest allegations after Thursday\u2019s hearing. Prosecutor Chris Conroy pointed to four of Trump\u2019s comments since last Monday \u2014 two were about Cohen, the others were about the jury and former AMI chief David Pecker. The district attorney\u2019s office wants Trump fined $1,000 for each violation but is not yet asking Merchan to jail him, noting the inconvenient slowing effect it\u2019d have on the trial. Witnesses don\u2019t have nice things to say about Michael Cohen: Davidson was just the latest witness to testify to unsavory things about Cohen \u2013 Trump\u2019s former fixer and a key prosecution witness who will testify later in the case. Davidson described how Cohen was difficult to deal with, frequently acting in a \u201Cpants on fire\u201D manner. Davidson testified that he had \u201Clost trust\u201D with Cohen to pay the money he\u2019d agreed to in the Daniels deal \u2013 and at one point he said the deal was off after Cohen failed to meet a deadline.

Catch up on what happened in Trump\u0027s hush money trial on Thursday From CNN\u0026#x27;s Elise Hammond Keith Davidson, a key witness who negotiated the Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal hush money agreements, was back on the stand on Thursday in the criminal trial against Donald Trump. The lawyer helped negotiate the deals to silence Daniels and McDougal over their alleged encounters with Trump. Davidson said in an interview with CNN in 2018 that he\u2019d spoken with Michael Cohen on several occasions about the two women. On cross-examination, the defense painted Davidson as a shady lawyer who goes \u201Cright up to the line without committing extortion\u201D on multiple cases involving not only Trump but other celebrities. The next witness was Douglas Daus, who works for the Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s office in the High Technology Analysis Unit. He is expected to continue his testimony today. Here\u2019s what happened in court Thursday: Prosecution: Davidson testified that he \u201Clost trust\u201D in Cohen due to the \u201Cdelays in funding\u201D after the deal with Daniels. When the amount came through, Davidson texted Dylan Howard, the National Enquirer editor who was helping broker the deal, that \u2014 \u201Cwas never really sure.\u201D Jurors also saw the confidential agreement between Daniels and the former president \u2014 under the pseudonyms David Dennison and Peggy Peterson. Notably, a side agreement includes Trump\u2019s real name and not Dennison\u2019s, written in Davidson\u2019s handwriting. The side letter agreement \u201Cdecodes\u201D the agreement that uses the pseudonyms, Davidson said. Davidson says he never saw a copy of the agreement where there was a signature on the line for \u201CDavid Dennison.\u201D Only Cohen signed the agreement on Trump\u2019s behalf. Davidson said he was paid $10,000 for his role. Davidson texted Howard \u201CWhat have we done\u201D on election night. \u201COh my god,\u201D Howard responded. Davidson testified that \u201Cthere was an understanding that our efforts may have in some way \u2014 strike that \u2014 our activities may have in some way assisted the presidential campaign of Donald Trump.\u201D Prosecutors also brought back up a Wall Street Journal story about McDougal published on November 4, 2016, just four days before the election. Davidson at the time represented McDougal who was engaged in a deal with AMI over her allegations of a relationship with Trump. Davidson said he spoke to Cohen \u201Cmore than once\u201D describing him as \u201Cvery upset that the article had been published.\u201D Defense cross-examination: Davidson said he had never had any personal interactions with Trump and that they had never been in the same room. Trump attorney Emil Bove pressed Davidson on whether he thought about legal exposure to extortion charges. Davidson has agreed that he knew in 2016 that he \u201Chad to be careful\u201D not to violate the law prohibiting extortion. But he did not agree when asked in 2016 if he had familiarized himself with the law of extortion. Davidson said he doesn\u2019t recall when asked about various celebrities and stories related to them and his alleged involvement. \u201CYour memory seems a little fuzzy around some of these issues,\u201D Bove jabbed at Davidson. Bove also asked about the time Davidson was investigated as part of a 2012 extortion probe tied to Hulk Hogan. Davidson said he learned later that Daniels\u2019 agent wanted a 2011 post taken down from a gossip website because they wanted a more lucrative deal. Davidson confirmed he used the word \u201Cleverage\u201D in a 2018 recorded conversation with Cohen, but answered, \u201Cno,\u201D when asked if it was Daniels\u2019 goal to use leverage against Trump. He also testified that Daniels wanted the money \u201Cmore than you could ever imagine.\u201D On redirect: The jury heard part of the call with Cohen on prosecutors\u2019 redirect on this line of questioning. Davidson said when he referenced \u201Cif he loses the election we lose all leverage\u201D that he was referring to what the boyfriend of Daniels\u2019 publicist Gina Rodriquez said, not what Daniels said. Karen McDougal: Davidson confirmed that McDougal had an interest in rejuvenating her career around the time he helped her reach the hush money deal. McDougal called the agreement a \u201Cdream deal,\u201D Davidson confirmed, adding she never wanted her story to be public. Davidson also said when Trump was ascending in the polls a \u201Cformer friend\u201D of McDougal attempted to publicize her interactions with Trump in the press. Douglas Daus Daus says he was assigned to analyze two iPhones that belonged to Cohen in the investigation related to Trump. They were obtained via a search warrant. Text messages were entered into evidence, including some messages between Cohen and Hope Hicks. Daus confirms Cohen had nearly 40,000 contacts on one of his phones including David Pecker, Hicks and Melania Trump, among others. There were 10 pages of contacts for Donald Trump, Daus said. Prosecutors played a recording from September 2016. It starts with Trump on a phone call. When he hangs up, Cohen can be heard saying: \u201CGreat call by the way. Big time.\u201D Cohen says he needs to open up a company, and that he\u2019s spoken with the Trump Organization\u2019s chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg about how to set the whole thing up. During cross-examination, Bove asked Daus about the importance of data integrity. Daus explained that the data has a \u201Cdigital fingerprint.\u201D Gag order hearing: Judge Juan Merchan held a gag order hearing Thursday morning to consider the prosecution\u2019s four additional allegations against Trump. Earlier in the week, the judge levied a $9,000 fine against Trump for multiple violations of the judge\u2019s gag order barring public discussion of witnesses in the case or the jury. Link Copied!

Two longtime Trump Organization employees walked the jury through financial documents at the heart of the charges against Trump and how Michael Cohen was paid back for the money he sent to Stormy Daniels\u2019 attorney.Deborah Tarasoff, who works in the accounting department, explained how checks were cut to Cohen in 2017 and she testified that invoices over $10,000 had to be approved by Trump or one of his sons. Earlier, former executive Jeffrey McConney testified about how Cohen\u0027s payments were listed in Trump\u0027s financial documents.Prosecutors accuse Trump of taking part in an illegal conspiracy to undermine the integrity of the 2016 election and an unlawful plan to suppress negative information, which included Cohen\u0027s hush money payment to Daniels. Trump has pleaded not guilty to 34 felony counts of falsifying business records.Meanwhile, the judge this morning ruled that Trump again violated his gag order for his comments about the jury. He threatened to jail Trump if he continues to violate it.Our live coverage of the trial has ended for the day. Court proceedings will resume tomorrow morning. share with Facebookshare with Twittershare with emailshare link144 PostsSort byLatestOldestDropdown arrow5:10 p.m. ET, May 6, 2024Witnesses walk through how bills were paid at Trump Org. Here\u2019s what happened in court and why it mattersFrom CNN\u0027s Elise HammondJeffrey McConney, right, testified on Monday. He was a longtime Trump Organization controller. Jane RosenbergIn the hush money trial against the former president, prosecutors called two witnesses Monday who worked in accounting in the Trump Organization: Jeffrey McConney, a former Trump Org. controller, and Deborah Tarasoff, an accounts payable supervisor.McConney walked the jury through the paper trail that showed how executives organized and paid back Michael Cohen for the money he sent to Stormy Daniels\u2019 attorney. This is important because at the heart of the trial \u2014 the falsification of business records \u2014 are the payments to Cohen, which were listed as retainer fees.Tarasoff described in more detail how checks were paid at the organization and when Trump\u2019s approval was needed for payments.Here\u2019s what happened in court today:Jeffrey McConneyMcConney testified that he had a conversation with Allen Weisselberg, former chief financial officer of the Trump Org., about a need to \u201Creimburse\u201D Cohen. McConney then showed jurors 12 checks, each for $35,000, that were paid to Cohen in 2017. Cohen sent invoices for those checks and asked that the payments be listed as part of a \u201Cretainer agreement.\u201D As previous testimony in the trial revealed, there was no actual retainer for Cohen.McConney also explained to the jury why Cohen was paid $420,000 in all and how each check was cut, first from Trump\u0027s revocable trust and then from his personal account.The jury also saw business records relating to the payment to Cohen that are tied to several of the 34 falsifying business records charges against Trump. The records show several rows and columns organized to record the payments.On cross-examination, Trump attorney Emil Bove questioned McConney about his knowledge of Trump\u0027s role in these payments. \u0022President Trump did not ask you to do any of the things you described?\u0022 Bove asked. \u0022He did not,\u0022 McConney testified. He said he was told to do this work by Weisselberg. McConney also said he did not know if Cohen did legal work for Trump in 2017.Deborah Tarasoff, who works in the Trump Organization accounting department, is questioned on Monday. Jane RosenbergDeborah TarasoffAs accounts payable supervisor, Tarasoff said she would get an approved invoice, enter it into the system, cut the check and get it signed. Tarasoff testified that Trump or his sons needed to approve invoices of more than $10,000 and Trump was the only person who authorized checks from his personal account, including during his presidency.Tarasoff said Trump would sign the checks by hand. She said they were signed in black Sharpie. Tarasoff said Trump did not always sign the checks, even when Weisselberg approved them. He would \u201Cwrite \u0027void\u0027 and send it back,\u201D she noted.Before Trump was president, Tarasoff testified that she \u201Cwould cut the check, put it with the backup and bring it over to Rhona (Graff) who would bring it in to Mr. Trump to sign,\u201D referring to Trump\u2019s former longtime assistant. The invoices and the checks were stapled together, she said, with the check on top of the invoice. When Trump became president, Tarasoff said they would mail checks to the White House.The jury was shown the voucher form that said \u0022retainer\u0022 in the description line that Tarasoff said she obtained from the invoice. Tarasoff also confirmed each of the $35,000 checks with Trump\u2019s signature were sent to Cohen.On cross-examination, she acknowledged that she was not present for conversations between Trump and Weisselberg about the payments. She also said she worked with Trump\u0027s children Eric, Don Jr. and Ivanka Trump, over the years. Tarasoff still works for Trump Org., which means she works for Eric Trump, who was also in the courtroom today.What\u2019s next: Prosecutor Joshua Steinglass estimated they still need about two weeks from tomorrow to make their case. He stresses that\u0027s a very rough estimate. The defense will also get an opportunity to call its witnesses after that if they choose.Judge Juan Merchan ruled that Trump again violated his gag order for his comments about the jury. Jane RosenbergGag order hearing: Judge Juan Merchan found Trump in contempt for violating the gag order again, specifically concerning comments he made about the makeup of the jury in this case. Prosecutors had alleged Trump violated the gag order on four separate occasions. The judge ruled that the three other comments did not violate the order. \u0022Going forward this court will have to consider a jail sanction,\u0022 Merchan said, noting the $1,000 fine is not stopping him, but he told Trump \u201Cincarceration is truly a last resort.\u201DRemember: Trump faces 34 counts of falsifying business records. Each criminal charge relates to a specific entry among the business records of the Trump Organization, according to the indictment. Prosecutors allege that Trump allegedly disguised the transaction to Daniels as a legal payment and falsified business records numerous times to \u201Cpromote his candidacy\u201D in the 2016 election.share with Facebookshare with Twittershare with emailshare link4:21 p.m. ET, May 6, 2024Prosecutors roughly estimate they need about two more weeks to make their case Judge Juan Merchan asks the prosecution how they\u0027re doing on timing for making their case.Prosecutor Joshua Steinglass says they\u0027re doing \u0022well,\u0022 but estimates they still need about two weeks from tomorrow.

When she created the checks, Trump would sign them, she testified \u2014 or, if he disapproved, he would write \u201Cvoid\u201D on them, she said.\u0022If he didn\u2019t want to sign it, he didn\u2019t sign it,\u0022 she said. She knew he was the one signing them because, \u0022It was signed in Sharpie and it was black and that\u2019s what he uses.\u0022She testified she had no decision-making authority but followed instructions, including getting invoices approved, entering them into the system, cutting the checks and getting them signed.On cross-examination, she acknowledged that she was not present for conversations between Trump and former Trump Org.

Apple says the M4\u0027s neural engine will support and accelerate tasks like real-time Live Captions, subject isolation during videos in Final Cut Pro and automatic musical nation in StaffPad.\u0026nbsp;\nSome other capabilities of the M4 chip include AV1 hardware acceleration \u2014 which is another first for the iPad line \u2014 and reduced memory requirements when performing inference-based workloads.\u0026nbsp;\nApple\u0027s M4 chip will be available first on the new 11- and 13-inch iPad Pros, which are available for pre-order today prior to official sales going live on May 15.\u0026nbsp;\nFollow all of the news live from Apple\u0027s \u0027Let Loose\u0027 event right here.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apples-m4-chip-arrives-with-a-big-focus-on-ai-142448428.html?src=rss","PublishDate":"2024-05-07T14:35:06","IsHeadline":false,"IsPaywall":false,"Summary":"Summary Unavailable.","ImageURL":"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/t1m9Gtlbx21FQZJ8d0aqgA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02Njg-/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-05/9a6987a0-0c7c-11ef-acbf-d336701bd058","PublisherID":16,"Business":false,"CompaniesMentioned":"SNR.L (Senior),","HasJakeFlag":false},{"Title":"Chad opposition condemns \u0027threats and violence\u0027 after high-stakes vote","Url":"https://www.france24.com/en/africa/20240508-chad-opposition-condemns-threats-and-violence-after-high-stakes-vote","Text":"Access DeniedAccess DeniedYou don\u0027t have permission to access \u0022/en/africa/20240508-chad-opposition-condemns-threats-and-violence-after-high-stakes-vote\u0022 on this server.0.1e58dd58.1715203241.1537472","RSSSummary":"\nThe party of Chadian prime minister and presidential candidate Succ\u00E8s Masra on Wednesday condemned violence and threats against him and his supporters, and alleged electoral fraud this week.\n","PublishDate":"2024-05-08T14:00:32","IsHeadline":false,"IsPaywall":false,"Summary":"Summary Unavailable.","ImageURL":"https://s.france24.com/media/display/5aaa11a2-0d3f-11ef-8f46-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/000_34QZ99A.jpg","PublisherID":14,"Business":false,"CompaniesMentioned":"","HasJakeFlag":false},{"Title":"\uD83D\uDD34 Live: South Gaza hospitals have only three days of fuel left, WHO says","Url":"https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20240508-\uD83D\uDD34-live-us-pauses-bomb-shipment-to-israel-over-rafah-concerns","Text":"Access DeniedAccess DeniedYou don\u0027t have permission to access \u0022/en/middle-east/20240508-%F0%9F%94%B4-live-us-pauses-bomb-shipment-to-israel-over-rafah-concerns\u0022 on this server.0.1e58dd58.1715203241.1537473","RSSSummary":"\nHospitals in the southern Gaza Strip have only three days of fuel left due to the closure of border crossings, the head of the World Health Organization\u00A0said Wednesday, warning that health services \u0022may soon come to a halt\u0022.

There\u2019s a long read on how bets on video networking software, static bikes and online retail destroyed $1.5tn in market value, and there\u2019s news from AstraZeneca that it\u2019s shelving its Covid-19 vaccine. Their common thread is that in investing, four years can be a lifetime. It was obvious from the start that when considering the importance of Covid treatments in general, and AstraZeneca\u2019s in particular, pharma company values were not the relevant measure. Still, it\u2019s easy to forget how much the hopes of vaccine profiteering moved markets in the run-up to the FDA giving the Pfizer-BioNTech jab emergency use authorisation in August 2021.A year earlier, SVB Leerink estimated that there was already $115bn of Covid vaccine value already priced into pharma stocks. To get anywhere close to that valuation would require biennial re-vaccination in perpetuity across the developed world, at a long-term list price of $30 per jab that was unaffected by competition, it said.Instead, demand vanished as governments wound down their buying programmes. Pfizer\u2019s first-quarter Covid vaccine revenue fell 88 per cent year on year to $354mn. Moderna\u2019s revenue was $167mn last quarter, down 91 per cent. Both companies guide for no near-term improvement and are pinning their hopes on combination jabs that offer protection against flu and respiratory illnesses as well as Covid.Stocks like Pfizer, J\u0026amp;J and Sanofi are diversified enough for falling expectations around Covid vaccines to not matter overly. For AstraZeneca, there expectation was always that its vaccine was a one-off endeavour, and the bubble had burst by the time its pledge to sell the jab at cost had expired.The real pain was concentrated among pure-play biotechs that were overhyped on trial progress as they rapidly ran out of money. Stocks like Moderna:But also Novavax:Cansino Biologics:Inovio Pharmaceuticals:Arcturus:Vaxart:Ibio:And Dynavax:It\u2019s not just a Covid story. Rising interest rates have destroyed all sorts of jam-tomorrow stocks by eroding the present value of potential earnings that were very far in the future, while the poor quality of biotech floats in 2020 and 2021 probably encouraged some investors to give up entirely on the sector.Whichever way, it all adds up to an expensive reminder of the long-odds lottery nature of drug development. Let\u2019s hope it\u2019s forgotten by the time the next pandemic arrives.Further reading\u2014 Small stocks, big problems (FTAV)Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2024.

The first-generation Apple Pencil, second-generation Apple Pencil, and lower-cost Apple Pencil with a USB-C port all remain available, making the Apple Pencil lineup more complex than ever for the time being.\n\n\n\nYou can order the Apple Pencil Pro now, and it launches May 15.Tag: Apple PencilRelated Forum: iPad AccessoriesThis article, \u0026quot;Apple Created These Five Different Designs for Apple Pencil Pro\u0026#039;s Box\u0026quot; first appeared on MacRumors.comDiscuss this article in our forums","PublishDate":"2024-05-08T09:02:51","IsHeadline":false,"IsPaywall":false,"Summary":"Summary Unavailable.","ImageURL":"https://images.macrumors.com/t/gx5NfIv0caaOk-ujLcShwOjnPak=/2500x/article-new/2024/05/M4-iPad-Pro-Wallpapers-Feature.jpg","PublisherID":22,"Business":false,"CompaniesMentioned":"III.L (3i),SNR.L (Senior),","HasJakeFlag":false},{"Title":"Apple Releases iTunes for Windows 12.13.2 With Support for New iPads","Url":"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/08/apple-releases-itunes-for-windows-12-13-2/","Text":" Apple Releases iTunes for Windows 12.13.2 With Support for New iPads - MacRumors Skip to ContentGot a tip for us?Let us know a.

If you really want a sticker, the report said you can still ask an employee for one while purchasing a new iPad Pro or iPad Air at an Apple Store. Apple also does not include stickers with the Vision Pro headset, but the new MacBook Air models released in March do come with them, so it appears that Apple is still in the process of gradually phasing out Apple stickers in the box for its latest products. Apple previously announced that it aimed to achieve plastic-free packaging by 2025.

The Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act that passed in April requires ByteDance to divest its TikTok ownership within nine months, with the possibility of a three-month extension if a deal is in progress. If TikTok is not sold off, the bill will prevent app stores and companies in the U.S. from providing the TikTok app to users. As of now, TikTok will be forced to shut down on January 19, 2025. ByteDance calls the act \u0022obviously unconstitutional,\u0022 and says that there is no path for TikTok to continue operating in the United States. The 270-day timeline is \u0022not possible,\u0022 and even if it were, the company claims that the act is still an \u0022extraordinary and unconstitutional assertion of power.\u0022 If upheld, it would allow the government to decide that a company may no longer own and publish the innovative and unique speech platform it created. If Congress can do this, it can circumvent the First Amendment by invoking national security and ordering the publisher of any individual newspaper or website to sell to avoid being shut down. And for TikTok, any such divestiture would disconnect Americans from the rest of the global community on a platform devoted to shared content -- an outcome fundamentally at odds with the Constitution\u0027s commitment to both free speech and individual liberty. The lawsuit argues that the act violates the First Amendment, and it claims that \u0022speculative and analytically flawed\u0022 concern over security and content manipulation is an insufficient reason for limiting the free speech of TikTok\u0027s 170 million U.S. users. ByteDance says that a U.S. TikTok platform would not be commercially viable because it would limit the pool of content, undermining \u0022the value and viability of the U.S. TikTok business.\u0022 ByteDance also claims that it would be technologically impossible to give the TikTok source code to a new owner because it would take years for new engineers to become familiar enough with the code to perform routine maintenance, plus the code would need to be rearchitected not to use ByteDance\u0027s software tools, which cannot be done in 270 days. The Chinese government has said that it will \u0022firmly oppose\u0022 any effort to sell TikTok to a U.S. company, and China would need to approve a sale. China has no intention of allowing the TikTok recommendation engine to be divested. ByteDance has already moved U.S. data to servers owned by Oracle, but U.S. lawmakers do not feel that is enough to protect users. There are few U.S. companies that could afford to purchase TikTok, and the tech giants that could buy it would likely be restricted from doing so due to antitrust concerns. ByteDance is asking the court to issue a declaratory judgment that the act violates the U.S. Constitution, preventing the U.S. Attorney General from enforcing it.

If TikTok is not sold off, the bill will prevent app stores and companies in the U.S. from providing the TikTok app to users. As of now, TikTok will be forced to shut down on January 19, 2025.\n\n\n\nByteDance calls the act \u0022obviously unconstitutional,\u0022 and says that there is no path for TikTok to continue operating in the United States. The 270-day timeline is \u0022not possible,\u0022 and even if it were, the company claims that the act is still an \u0022extraordinary and unconstitutional assertion of power.\u0022\n\nIf upheld, it would allow the government to decide that a company may no longer own and publish the innovative and unique speech platform it created. If Congress can do this, it can circumvent the First Amendment by invoking national security and ordering the publisher of any individual newspaper or website to sell to avoid being shut down. And for TikTok, any such divestiture would disconnect Americans from the rest of the global community on a platform devoted to shared content -- an outcome fundamentally at odds with the Constitution\u0027s commitment to both free speech and individual liberty.\n\nThe lawsuit argues that the act violates the First Amendment, and it claims that \u0022speculative and analytically flawed\u0022 concern over security and content manipulation is an insufficient reason for limiting the free speech of TikTok\u0027s 170 million U.S. users.\n\n\n\nByteDance says that a U.S. TikTok platform would not be commercially viable because it would limit the pool of content, undermining \u0022the value and viability of the U.S. TikTok business.\u0022 ByteDance also claims that it would be technologically impossible to give the TikTok source code to a new owner because it would take years for new engineers to become familiar enough with the code to perform routine maintenance, plus the code would need to be rearchitected not to use ByteDance\u0027s software tools, which cannot be done in 270 days.\n\n\n\nThe Chinese government has said that it will \u0022firmly oppose\u0022 any effort to sell TikTok to a U.S. company, and China would need to approve a sale. China has no intention of allowing the TikTok recommendation engine to be divested. ByteDance has already moved U.S. data to servers owned by Oracle, but U.S. lawmakers do not feel that is enough to protect users.\n\n\n\nThere are few U.S. companies that could afford to purchase TikTok, and the tech giants that could buy it would likely be restricted from doing so due to antitrust concerns.\n\n\n\nByteDance is asking the court to issue a declaratory judgment that the act violates the U.S. Constitution, preventing the U.S. Attorney General from enforcing it.Tag: TikTokThis article, \u0026quot;TikTok Sues U.S. Government Over Bill Requiring Sale\u0026quot; first appeared on MacRumors.comDiscuss this article in our forums","PublishDate":"2024-05-08T08:35:20","IsHeadline":true,"IsPaywall":false,"Summary":"TikTok Sues US Government Over Bill Requiring Sale\n\nThe US government is facing a lawsuit from ByteDance, the parent company ofTikTok.

U.S. paused bomb shipment to Israel to signal concerns over Rafah, official says May 8, 20243:01 AM ET By\u0026nbsp; The Associated Press Enlarge this image Smoke rises following an Israeli airstrike east of Rafah, Gaza Strip, this past Monday. Ismael Abu Dayyah/AP hide caption toggle caption Ismael Abu Dayyah/AP Smoke rises following an Israeli airstrike east of Rafah, Gaza Strip, this past Monday. Ismael Abu Dayyah/AP WASHINGTON \u2014 The U.S. paused a shipment of bombs to Israel last week over concerns that Israel was approaching a decision on launching a full-scale assault on the southern Gaza city of Rafah against the wishes of the U.S., a senior administration official said Tuesday. The shipment was supposed to consist of 1,800 2,000-pound (900-kilogram) bombs and 1,700 500-pound (225-kilogram) bombs, according to the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive matter, with the focus of U.S. concern being the larger explosives and how they could be used in a dense urban setting. More than 1 million civilians are sheltering in Rafah after evacuating other parts of Gaza amid Israel\u0027s war on Hamas, which came after the militant group\u0027s deadly attack on Israel on Oct. 7. Politics A closer look at U.S. military support for Israel The U.S. has historically provided enormous amounts of military aid for Israel. That has only accelerated in the aftermath of Hamas\u0027 Oct. 7 attack that killed some 1,200 in Israel and led to about 250 being taken captive by militants. The pausing of the aid shipment is the most striking manifestation of the growing daylight between Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u0027s government and the administration of President Joe Biden, which has called on Israel to do far more to protect the lives of innocent civilians in Gaza. It also comes as the Biden administration is due to deliver a first-of-its-kind formal verdict this week on whether the airstrikes on Gaza and restrictions on delivery of aid have violated international and U.S. laws designed to spare civilians from the worst horrors of war. A decision against Israel would further add to pressure on Biden to curb the flow of weapons and money to Israel\u0027s military. Biden\u0027s administration in April began reviewing future transfers of military assistance as Netanyahu\u0027s government appeared to move closer toward an invasion of Rafah, despite months of opposition from the White House. The official said the decision to pause the shipment was made last week and no final decision had been made yet on whether to proceed with the shipment at a later date. U.S. officials had declined for days to comment on the halted transfer, word of which came as Biden on Tuesday described U.S. support for Israel as \u0022ironclad, even when we disagree.\u0022 Press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre declined to square the arms holdup with Biden\u0027s rhetoric in support of Israel, saying only, \u0022Two things could be true.\u0022 Middle East crisis \u2014 explained Israeli forces seize the Gaza side of Rafah, as Hamas truce talks resume in Egypt Israeli troops on Tuesday seized control of Gaza\u0027s vital Rafah border crossing in what the White House described as a limited operation that stopped short of the full-on Israeli invasion of the city that Biden has repeatedly warned against on humanitarian grounds, most recently in a Monday call with Netanyahu. Israel has ordered the evacuation of 100,000 Palestinians from the city. Israeli forces have also carried out what it describes as \u0022targeted strikes\u0022 on the eastern part of Rafah and captured the Rafah crossing, a critical conduit for the flow of humanitarian aid along the Gaza-Egypt border. Privately, concern has mounted inside the White House about what\u0027s unfolding in Rafah, but publicly administration officials have stressed that they did not think the operations had defied Biden\u0027s warnings against a widescale operation in the city. White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said Israel described the operation along the Gaza-Egypt border in eastern Rafah as \u0022an operation of limited scale and duration\u0022 aimed at cutting off Hamas arms smuggling, but also said the U.S. would monitor the fighting. Just last month, Congress passed a $95 billion national security bill that included funding for Ukraine, Israel and other allies. The package included more than $14 billion in military aid for Israel, though the stalled transfer was not related to that measure. Middle East crisis \u2014 explained UN human rights body calls for halt to weapons shipments to Israel The State Department is separately considering whether to approve the continued transfer of Joint Direct Attack Munition kits, which place precision guidance systems onto bombs, to Israel, but the review didn\u0027t pertain to imminent shipments. The U.S. dropped the 2,000-pound bomb sparingly in its long war against the Islamic State militant group. Israel, by contrast, has used the bomb frequently in the seven-month Gaza war. Experts say the use of the weapon, in part, has helped drive the enormous Palestinian casualty count that the Hamas-run health ministry puts at more than 34,000 dead, though it doesn\u0027t distinguish between militants and civilians. The U.S.-Israel relationship has been close through both Democratic and Republican administrations. But there have been other moments of deep tension since the founding in which U.S. leaders have threatened to hold up aid in attempt to sway Israeli leadership. President Dwight Eisenhower pressured Israel with the threat of sanctions into withdrawing from the Sinai in 1957 in the midst of the Suez Crisis. Ronald Reagan delayed the delivery of F16 fighter jets to Israel at a time of escalating violence in the Middle East. President George H.W. Bush held up $10 billion in loan guarantees to force the cessation of Israeli settlement activity in the occupied territories.

As many have noted, it is a significant moment in hip-hop history, and not just because Mr. Lamar\u2019s diss track \u201CNot Like Us,\u201D released last week, has become the hip-hop song with the most plays on U.S. Spotify in a single day \u2014 surpassing the high set previously by Drake and Lil Baby.\r\n\r\nWhat sets this rap battle apart from previous high-profile hip-hop feuds is its magnitude and implications for popular music. Hip-hop, born as an underground movement, has long been a global phenomenon, leading certain artists to blur the lines between authenticity and commercialization. The global pop audience has always been more drawn to a simplified hip-hop sound devoid of the complex lyrics and politicized messages that characterize \u201Cconscious\u201D rap.\r\n\r\nMr. Lamar\u2019s victory signals a resurgence of lyrically rich rap \u2014 and a return to the roots of hip-hop culture \u2014 all while establishing a new template for relevance in an era when content can go viral instantly on social media and streaming platforms. If Drake, who has become the face of rap\u2019s mainstream pop faction, has lost this battle, that setback is not his alone.\r\n\r\nMr. Lamar\u2019s ability to write layered and intricate lyrics has long been lauded. But this battle has brought new attention and enthusiasm to the particular artistic element at which he excels. Fans have scrambled to decipher his complex verses with each new release. (The website Genius, where users annotate lyrics, crashed from the volume of visitors investigating this feud.) Mr. Lamar\u2019s apparent decision to remove copyright protections for \u201CNot Like Us\u201D has also enabled a wide dissemination of the track, allowing content creators to monetize posts featuring the song.\r\n\r\nRemoving these kind of constraints on the distribution of the song signals a new and savvy approach to marketing and sales in the music industry. It\u2019s another facet of Mr. Lamar\u2019s victory \u2014 enlisting countless unseen collaborators to spread his message and join his crusade.\r\n\r\nDrake has been doing his best to counter and innovate. His second volley in the battle, \u201CTaylor Made Freestyle,\u201D incorporated A.I. to enlist two iconic figures from West Coast hip-hop: Tupac Shakur and Snoop Dogg. (Drake removed the song from social media after objections from Mr. Shakur\u2019s estate). Drake also took direct aim at Mr. Lamar\u2019s supposed lyrical prowess, taunting him to respond with a \u201Cquintuple entendre.\u201D\r\n\r\nUnderestimating Mr. Lamar \u2014 who won a Pulitzer Prize for his album \u201CDAMN.\u201D \u2014 was a questionable move. Mr. Lamar\u2019s response, \u201CEuphoria,\u201D arrived with the precision and effectiveness of a heat-seeking missile. The title \u201CEuphoria\u201D nods not only to the feeling but to the HBO series on which Drake has been an executive producer \u2014 a show known for its controversial portrayal of teenage sexuality, a parallel that underscores Mr. Lamar\u2019s allegations that Drake harbors inappropriate infatuations.\r\n\r\nIn the arena of rap battles, entendres are wielded precisely because they imbue words with layers of meaning. Nowhere is this more evident than in the stark contrast between love and hate, the poles around which rap oscillates. In a pivotal moment in \u201CEuphoria,\u201D Mr. Lamar adopted the persona of the late rapper DMX, who in 2012 aired his grievances about Drake on \u201CThe Breakfast Club,\u201D a radio show that was a cornerstone of hip-hop media. On the track, Mr. Lamar echoes DMX as he snarls at Drake, \u201CI hate the way that you walk, the way that you talk, I hate the way that you dress.\u201D\r\n\r\nDrake parried by questioning Mr. Lamar\u2019s authenticity, characterizing his portrayal of Black empowerment as superficial and insincere. But Mr. Lamar swiftly retaliated, targeting Drake\u2019s alleged cultural appropriation. Authenticity in hip-hop is often tied to a rapper\u2019s ability to embody the distinctive sound of their hometown \u2014 something Drake, a Canadian of ambiguous racial identity, has skillfully transcended, crossing geographical and musical boundaries and incorporating regional sounds from across the United States, particularly the South.\r\n\r\nIn the closing lines of \u201CNot Like Us,\u201D Mr. Lamar zeros in on what he sees as Drake\u2019s vulnerability. Mr. Lamar\u2019s artistry shines through as he seamlessly weaves together social commentary and catchy rhythms. He begins by evoking the painful legacy of Black Americans in chains, then highlights Atlanta\u2019s historical significance as a hub for the slave trade in the South \u2014 before drawing parallels to Drake\u2019s exploitation of Southern rap culture for personal gain. His indictment culminates with a damning accusation: \u201CYou run to Atlanta when you need a few dollars,\u201D he says. Drake is not a \u201Ccolleague,\u201D he\u2019s a \u201Ccolonizer.\u201D\r\n\r\nThrough his incisive lyrics Mr. Lamar exposes the complexities of cultural identity and power dynamics within the rap industry \u2014 all while carrying the banner of lyrical rap. His verbal offensive proves the depth and staying power of hip-hop\u2019s history and culture, with its legacy of lyrical dexterity and complexity.\r\n\r\nArmed with these tools and talents, Mr. Lamar managed to topple Drake, and in the process has shown himself, by calling on hip-hop\u2019s traditions, to be more relevant to the current moment. At least until the bell sounds to signal the next round.\r\n\r\nLaurence Ralph is a professor of anthropology at Princeton and the author of \u201CSito: An American Teenager and the City That Failed Him.\u201D\r\n\r\nSource photographs by Arturo Holmes/MG23 and Prince Williams, via Getty Images.\r\n\r\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

The abuses they suffer demand our immediate attention, compassion and action. While some violations are clear and there are mechanisms and institutions to investigate them and offer recourse, others are not so apparent. One example of the latter is environmental war crimes.\r\n\r\nWe are only beginning to understand the full extent of wars\u2019 impact on air, water and the natural environment; on soils and agriculture; on energy and water infrastructure; and ultimately, on public health and safety. The challenge is that much of this cannot be easily seen and has not yet been sufficiently studied, and it is likely that the victims of this less visible side of war may be far greater in number than imagined.\r\n\r\nWhere there are crumbled buildings, there may be deadly asbestos and silica dust dispersed into the air. Where there are landmines and unexploded ordnance, or damaged industrial sites, there may be leaks of heavy metals and other potent pollutants, some of which last for generations. Where lakes and farm fields are poisoned, food security suffers.\r\n\r\nToday\u2019s international law already includes tools to prosecute war crimes that do disproportionate damage to the environment, but prosecutions for such crimes have been rare in either local or international courts. Reparations for this damage has also been far too limited, with claims in international tribunals meeting evidentiary roadblocks.\r\n\r\nThere are some positive signs that this could change. The UN General Assembly brought attention to this issue in an important\u00A0resolution in 2022 on the protection of the environment in relation to armed conflicts, which notes the responsibility of states to provide full reparations for environmental damage due to wrongful acts in war. On March 1, the UN Environment Assembly passed a consensus resolution\u00A0that called for better data collection on the environmental damage associated with armed conflict.\r\n\r\nThe prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, Karim Khan, also recently announced\u00A0that his office is developing a comprehensive policy on environmental crimes, with a firm commitment to advance accountability for these crimes.\r\n\r\nA real challenge is to track environmental damage even while a conflict is under way. But this is essential in order to protect public health and take urgent measures to limit damage, such as stopping active leaks of deadly pollutants into rivers or farmland. Documenting the damage is also important in order to ensure full reparations are eventually paid, as is required if it is caused by illegal acts of war, and so that individual perpetrators can be held to account.\r\n\r\nAn important contribution in this area is emerging in Ukraine.\r\n\r\nRussia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine has had a terrible impact on the natural environment. Ukraine is a country with impressive biodiversity and important nature reserves, but the war has devastated many areas. Soils and waterways have been polluted with chemicals, while farmland, forests and green spaces have been ravaged by shelling, fires and floods.\r\n\r\nThe destruction of the Kakhovka dam a year ago, presumed to have been an intentional act by the occupying Russian forces, flooded villages and farmlands and caused widespread ecological damage all the way to the Black Sea.\r\n\r\nOn top of this, one-third of Ukraine\u2019s territory is now suspected to be contaminated with landmines or unexploded ordnance, surpassing any other country in the world,\u00A0according to\u00A0the International Campaign to Ban Landmines.\r\n\r\nWe have been part of an effort to bring these environmental concerns to the world\u2019s attention by joining a bold initiative by the president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\r\n\r\nThe president created the High-Level Working Group on the Environmental Consequences of the War in Ukraine, of which we are pleased to be members, and included environmental security as a core element of the Peace Formula that he proposed as a framework for ending the war.\r\n\r\nThis working group recently published a broad set of recommendations in an \u201CEnvironmental Compact\u201D (PDF) which points to three priorities.\r\n\r\nFirst, there is a need to establish clear guidance for documenting environmental damage, employing modern technologies. By working with international partners to establish such standards, Ukraine can help guide how environmental damage is documented in all conflicts.\r\n\r\nSecond, with this data and evidence in hand, we must ensure criminal accountability and full reparations. There are important efforts already under way at the national and international levels, but there is space to expand them.\r\n\r\nA national strategy for environmental justice, currently being developed by the prosecutor general in Ukraine, is a step in the right direction. At the international level, there should be more attention paid to these crimes in foreign courts, including through cases that apply universal jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nInvestigators and prosecutors should adopt a\u00A0victim-centred approach\u00A0to understanding environmental damage and the redress needed. Human rights investigations in Ukraine should give special attention to environmental damage and the risks to public health, as they assess rights violations.\r\n\r\nFinally, the working group points to the imperative of sustainable reconstruction, incorporating development strategies that are friendly to the climate and to the environment. Efforts to apply these principles must begin now, as rebuilding is already under way in some parts of Ukraine.\r\n\r\nGreen justice and green recovery in Ukraine will be to the benefit of all countries affected by conflict around the world. When Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine two years ago, the Kremlin put the international legal order at risk. Its actions are a clear violation of international law and the UN Charter. The future\u00A0of this international order, and the expectation of justice for such flagrant violations, will be determined by how the world continues to respond to this aggression, including the terrible and disproportionate attacks on the environment.\r\n\r\nWe all know that environmental threats do not stop at borders. The risk of a significant nuclear radiation disaster that hangs over Ukraine \u2013 due to the Russian occupation of the Zaporizhyya Nuclear Power Plant, Europe\u2019s largest \u2013 is one worrying example of the regional threat. Another is the war\u2019s impact on the Black Sea, where environmental damage is having deadly effects on sea life and impacts all countries bordering this important body of water.\r\n\r\nNow that the world is awakening to the scale of environmental crimes in conflicts, we must work to ensure that accountability follows, addressing both individual crimes and the responsibility to repair the harm by the perpetrator state.\r\n\r\nJustice is due in Ukraine. And justice is due equally in all conflicts where force exceeds agreed legal limits. Let us work together for a green, just and peaceful future for those nations now suffering such attacks.\r\n\r\nThe views expressed in this article are the authors\u2019 own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera\u2019s editorial stance.","RSSSummary":"Ukrainian efforts to document and prosecute atrocities linked to the environment can help with accountability elsewhere.","PublishDate":"2024-05-11T12:07:44","IsHeadline":true,"IsPaywall":false,"Summary":"War has widespread consequences beyond military impacts on human life; it also devastates ecosystems worldwide through environmental war crimes, leaving lasting damage that affects public health long after conventional warfare ends. The lack of accountability for these violations hinders justice efforts to repair the affected environments and prevent future atrocities in conflict zones.\n\nThe international legal framework includes tools like prosecuting wartime environment offenses but prosecutions have been rare due to evidentiary challenges or limitations on jurisdiction within existing institutions. However, recent resolutions highlight growing awareness about environmental damage caused by armed conflicts prompting increased attention from organizations such as UNEP and ICCP. Initiatives are underway at national levels for reparations while documenting damaged environments is crucial both during ongoing conflict situations and after peace settlements.\n\nEnvironmental crimes in Ukraine resulting directly or indirectly from the war have had devastating consequences on biodiversity, farmland, forests, and waterways with widespread ecological damage extending beyond Ukrainian borders into neighboring countries like Black Sea states.

Cole\u0027s collaboration on the track First Person Shooter in October 2023.\r\n\r\nJ. Cole said on First Person Shooter that he, Drake and Lamar were the \u0022big three\u0022 of hip hop. Lamar would reject that idea by rapping that \u0022it\u0027s just big me\u0022 on record producer Metro Boomin and rapper Future\u0027s collaboration on the song Like That.\r\n\r\nImage source, Getty Images\r\nImage caption,\r\nDrake, Kendrick Lamar and J Cole\r\n\r\nHow times change\r\n\r\nIn the early days of rap, you might only catch diss tracks on a copied cassette, from an in-the-know radio station, or by seeing a performance at a club. Lamar and Drake\u0027s super-charged rap beef made it clear that this has now changed forever.\r\n\r\n\u0022I think when you look at this battle, it is going to surpass every other battle because of how it was able to crossover to pop culture so quickly,\u0022 said Carl Lamarre, Billboard\u0027s deputy director of R\u0026B and Hip-Hop.\r\n\r\nEven in the recent past, audiences might have had to wait months to hear a feud play out. Jay-Z released the diss track, Takeover, in September 2001 to ridicule fellow New Yorker, Nas. It took his target three months to reply on Ether.\r\n\r\nAt one time, releasing a diss was an element of performative competition within the hip-hop community. It was used to claim a hip-hop throne, often by rappers who were trying to grow their platform at a local level and to hustle for another show or record contract.\r\n\r\nAudiences, in turn, would have to put in work to follow if a rap beef progressed past a night at the club, Bill Stephney, a former executive at Def Jam Records, recalled.\r\n\r\nWhen he was coming up in New York City in the 1980s, Mr Stephney said fans would capture diss tracks on tape, and those who were interested were lucky to get a version that could be listened to. They were often copied hundreds of times from one cassette to another, each iteration decreasing the sound quality until the track was hardly audible.\r\n\r\nThis YouTube post cannot be displayed in your browser.

YouTube content may contain adverts.\r\n\r\nMr Stephney said he worked hard to obtain a prized cassette of Roxanne Shante, a female rapper who helped popularise the diss track at 14 years old in New York. She led a series of well-known rap feuds and rivalries called the Roxanne Wars in the 1980s.\r\n\r\nThe immediacy with which artists are now able to release songs directly on social media, even before they hit digital streaming platforms, means the two rappers can speak directly to each other and to their audiences. Their fans can also then react and respond in real time, and it can rapidly be picked up by popular culture\r\n\r\n\u0022Fast forward 40 years [from the Roxanne Wars], and now Kendrick and Drake can create something and rather than having it be dubbed 200 times for New York-area fans to check it out, they can just simply upload it within seconds,\u0022 Mr Stephney said.\r\n\r\n\u0022That 100 million people can consume that so quickly is just such a profound technological change. It\u0027s hard to even fathom it.\u0022\r\n\r\nThe two men\u0027s diss tracks have produced countless Reddit forums, YouTube explainers and media think-pieces. And the songs that stem from their feud have led the streaming charts in recent weeks.\r\n\r\nLamar\u0027s most recent release, Not Like Us, is among the most streamed song in the world at the moment, coming in at #1 on Apple Music in 40 countries earlier this week, and it is expected to debut at #1 on the Billboard charts in the coming days.\r\n\r\nImage source, Getty Images\r\nImage caption,\r\nKendrick Lamar kept the pressure on Drake, at one point releasing three songs in the space of 36 hours\r\n\r\nNot Like Us has also been played on US television during an NBA playoff game, it\u0027s been heard blasting from the speakers at the Los Angeles Dodgers\u0027 stadium and tennis star Naomi Osaka said she listened to it before taking the court at the Italian Open.\r\n\r\nLamar\u0027s other diss track Euphoria, meanwhile, was used by President Joe Biden\u0027s campaign in a video attempting to throw shade at Republican contender and former president Donald Trump.\r\n\r\n\u0022At one time, it was really those people who were really part of the subculture who would know about [rap beefs], and they followed it fervently - but it wasn\u0027t accessible,\u0022 said Pete Nice, the co-curator of the Hip Hop Museum in the Bronx and a founding member of hip-hop group 3rd Bass.\r\n\r\n\u0022You had to actually go buy a cassette or vinyl, and you had to listen to the radio to be in the know. Now, all these kids have everything in the palm of their hands.\u0022\r\n\r\nSerious accusations\r\n\r\nWhile the songs are clearly popular and have delighted fans, they have also showcased the darker side of a beef playing out to an audience of millions. Accusations of domestic violence, secret children and paedophilia have all been shared on the tracks without evidence - and with both men denying the accusations against them.\r\n\r\nWest Coast rap icon Ice Cube, who famously was at the centre of a number of rap feuds in the 1990s, said in a recent interview with Etalk CTV that both sides have much to lose because of how much attention these diss tracks have received. He noted that in the past there have been times when these disputes have turned violent.\r\n\r\n\u0022They\u0027re volatile\u0022, he said of rap disputes. \u0022You always have to be careful that a beef doesn\u0027t turn into a murder. Back in the day, you do a diss record, but it would stay\u2026 in the hip-hop community. Now, it\u0027s all over the world, all walks of life know what\u0027s going on and, you know, some people can\u0027t really take that kind of humiliation.\u0022\r\n\r\nImage source, Getty Images\r\nImage caption,\r\nTupac Shakur, the New-York born rapper, moved to San Francisco in 1988 and became closely associated with West Coast hip hop\r\n\r\nMr Stephney recalled the Tupac Shakur and Biggie Smalls rap feuds that led to the two men\u0027s deaths in the mid-1990s. He noted that a security guard was recently shot outside Drake\u0027s home, which has also played host to two other police-involved incidents since the shooting.\r\n\r\nWhile these disturbances have not been connected by authorities to Drake\u0027s dispute with Lamar, the former record producer said he fears the two rappers\u0027 feud could lead to real-world violence.\r\n\r\n\u0022It made absolutely no sense when it happened 28 years ago,\u0022 Mr Stephney said of Tupac\u0027s and Biggie\u0027s murders. \u0022I just hope those were lessons learned by these two guys and they see the terrible excuses for violence that occurred at that time.\u0022\r\n\r\nTensions seem to have simmered down in recent days, though the public will have to wait to see what effects the beef may have on the stars\u0027 reputations.\r\n\r\nThat does not mean fans and casual observers are not keeping their eyes peeled for another diss track release, however. The last track - Drake\u0027s THE HEART PART 6 - was delivered less than a week ago on 5 May. And it is clear that fans want more.\r\n\r\n\u0022This is the kind of rivalry that people favour. It\u0027s Nadal-Federer, Lakers-Celtics, Yankees-Red Sox,\u0022 Mr Lamarre said. \u0022These are two different artists with amazing accolades that have two different backgrounds.\u0022\r\n\r\n\u0022And it just forms a community as people sit around the internet bonfire and wait for that next diss track to be released.\u0022\r\n\r\nMore on this story","RSSSummary":"Rapid-fire releases and fast pace of modern life elevate diss war to levels unparalleled in hip-hop history.","PublishDate":"2024-05-11T12:00:51","IsHeadline":true,"IsPaywall":false,"Summary":"Kendrick Lamar vs Drake: A Public Feud of Unprecedented Scope:\n\nThe rap battle between KendrickLamarandDrake has captivated fans worldwide, setting new standards in public discourse.

Many building foundations have sunk dramatically while others have a visible lean, resulting in cracks in the surrounding pavement. Two of the city\u2019s most iconic structures \u2013 The Palacio de Bellas Artes and the Metropolitan Cathedral (built from the stones of the Aztec temple that once stood there) \u2013 seem to be disappearing into the earth.\r\n\r\nInside the cathedral, Solano-Rojas, a professor of geological engineering at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, points to a glass-encased box connected to the ceiling by a taut wire. At the centre of the nave hangs a heavily-weighted point, which charts a line indicating how the cathedral has shifted unevenly over the centuries, with the worst-impacted section dropping by some 2.5 metres (8.2 feet).\r\n\nAt the centre of the Metropolitan Cathedral\u2019s nave hangs a weight that tracks the cathedral\u2019s motion across the centuries [Nick Hilden/Al Jazeera]\n\r\nMexico City is sinking, as are its greatest monuments. Parts of the city of nearly 9 million people are descending into the earth by as much as 40cm (15 inches) annually \u2013 all driven by a deepening water crisis with roots that go back 500 years, and that reveals itself today in stunning ironies.\r\n\r\nOne of Mexico City\u2019s most renowned attractions, the canals of Xochimilco, with their lush lagoons and colourfully decorated boats, date back to the precolonial lake that once satiated the city\u2019s thirst. Today, its adjacent neighbourhoods have run out of water.\r\n\r\nTo its north is Iztapalapa, one of the city\u2019s most notoriously impoverished, dangerous colonias (neighbourhoods), where the water supply has been inconsistent for years. It frequently slows to a trickle or stops entirely for days and even weeks.\r\n\r\nWhile it is, sadly, not surprising that a disenfranchised district would experience breakdowns in essential services, perhaps more unanticipated are the water shortages in the adjacent region of Coyoacan, an upper-crust neighbourhood best known as the once-home of painting power couple Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera.\r\n\nA boy carries home buckets filled from barrels of drinking water loaded from tanker trucks in the Mexico City borough of Iztapalapa [Yuri Cortez/AFP]\n\r\nAt the heart of the city\u2019s struggle \u2013 and its sinking \u2013 is its reliance on underground water. As the underground aquifer drains and the ground above it settles, the city sinks deeper and deeper. \u201CThere\u2019s one solution: Stop taking water from underground,\u201D says Solano-Rojas. \u201CBut that\u2019s not going to happen.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe situation in Mexico City shows how the rich and the poor are both ill-prepared for when water supplies run dry \u2013 and money can only go so far.\r\n\nA problem for the ages\n\r\n\u201CI was born with this problem existing,\u201D says Solano-Rojas. \u201CI thought it was normal everywhere, but it\u2019s not.\u201D\r\n\r\nTo understand the \u201Csubsidence\u201D of the city and the water shortage causing it, it is necessary to look back half a millennium. The Aztecs had already erected a civilisation atop and amid the local network of lakes, most notably the capital of Tenochtitlan, which stood on the site of Mexico City\u2019s present-day central district.\r\n\r\nHad the penultimate Aztec ruler Moctezuma\u2019s empire been allowed to continue expanding, it is possible that it would have eventually run into similar water supply issues. But the arrival of the Spanish conquistador Hernan Cortes and his colonial forces disrupted all that \u2013 they levelled Tenochtitlan and built their own city in its place.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s a historical problem,\u201D explains Elena Tudela Rivadeneyra, a professor of architecture at the National Autonomous University of Mexico and the co-founder of the Office of Urban Resilience, which develops strategies to help cities weather climate change. \u201CEver since we decided to dry out the lake system that we had here \u2013 and that started [shortly after the Spanish arrived] around 1608 \u2013 we started having a difficult relationship with water.\u201D\r\n\r\nDraining the lakes and building over them created two major issues. First, it diminished the local water supply, requiring the city to import much of its fresh water \u2013 a significant portion of which must be pumped at great expense more than 100 metres (328 feet) up the sierra where the city perches. Second, as the city grew and consumed what water remained, the subsidence began. Problems snowballed from there.\r\n\nThe camera is level but the buildings in the Zocalo are not. Riot police stand at the bottom behind the barriers \u2013 the building to the right is the National Palace where protests are frequent [Nick Hilden/Al Jazeera]\nA sinking city\n\r\nOne of the first things you notice as you land in Mexico City is that the airport runway is unusually bumpy. The increasingly uneven tarmac is a consequence of subsidence.\r\n\r\nListing buildings and uneven roads may be the most obvious impact of the subsidence, but bigger problems lurk out of view.\r\n\r\nA recent study found that the integrity of the metro is progressively compromised \u2013 and there is more, \u201CIt also breaks the pipes,\u201D says Tudela Rivadeneyra.\r\n\r\nWhen Mexico City began modernising its municipal water supply during the 1940s \u2013 an event that Diego Rivera celebrated with the creation of stunning underwater murals you can visit at the C\u00E1rcamo Museum in Chapultepec Park \u2013 its population was only a few million. As that number exploded to the 22.5 million living there today, the water infrastructure not only failed to keep up with the rising demand, but was continually torn apart by subsidence.\r\n\r\nNow, the city is losing some 40 percent of its water due to leaks in broken pipes.\r\n\nThe murals of Deigo Rivera commemorating the construction of the municipal water system at the C\u00E1rcamo Museum in Chapultepec Park in Mexico City [Nick Hilden/Al Jazeera]\n\r\n\u201CThe leakages are quite difficult to deal with,\u201D says Tudela Rivadeneyra. \u201CEven if you replace them with new materials and more elastic and technical and technological solutions, you still have quite an issue.\u201D\r\n\r\nWater infrastructure has become a top consideration among voters in the city\u2019s upcoming mayoral elections, and while candidates have made bold claims about fast fixes, Tudela Rivadeneyra says these are unrealistic. She notes that even if the city had the money for it \u2013 and it does not \u2013 the sheer amount of construction required for a rapid infrastructure rebuild is untenable in a city where people are forced to commute sometimes for hours each day. The increase in the city\u2019s already notorious traffic would grind it to a standstill.\r\n\r\nAs Mexico City runs out of water, for many, the taps are already running dry.\r\n\nThe stones around Bellas Artes are cracking and require frequent repair [Nick Hilden/Al Jazeera]\nDay Zero is already here\n\r\nIn the discussion of the city\u2019s water crisis, the term \u201CDay Zero\u201D is frequently thrown around to describe the presumed date when wells will run dry. Many have set it for late June. But the situation is complicated.\r\n\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t think a Day Zero is going to come,\u201D says Solano-Rojas. \u201CDay Zero has already happened.\u201D\r\n\r\nWhile popular central districts like Condesa and Roma are still relatively unscathed by the situation \u2013 though many of their once-majestic fountains now stand dry \u2013 residents in areas like Iztapalapa and Coyoacan will tell you that the concept of Day Zero is practically meaningless.\r\n\r\n\u201CDay Zero has been here for a lot of people around the whole metropolitan area,\u201D says Tudela Rivadeneyra. \u201CTwenty-five percent of the population does not receive enough water. Technically speaking, 98 percent of the population has the infrastructure to get it, but that doesn\u2019t mean that you open up the tap and there\u2019s water.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe issue extends beyond Mexico City proper.\r\n\r\n\u201CWe don\u2019t have water at home on Saturdays and Sundays,\u201D says Israel, a resident of the nearby town of Toluca. \u201CMonday to Friday, the situation is irregular. There may be a day or two with water and the rest of the weekdays, we only get a very small amount.\u201D\r\n\r\nAnd in Cuernavaca, roughly an hour south of Mexico City, residents have blocked the highway to protest water shortages.\r\n\nStanding at the high rear of the Church of San Francisco, it is clear that the nave floor is sinking [Nick Hilden/Al Jazeera]\n\r\nThe situation has forced the use of stopgap solutions that can only go so far. \u201CPeople can ask for trucks with water in those areas in which the situation is critical,\u201D says Israel. \u201CBut the common solution with some people and local businesses I\u2019ve talked with is that they are paying for private trucks to deliver them water.\u201D\r\n\r\nThese water trucks \u2013 frequently accompanied by armed guards \u2013 are becoming ubiquitous throughout the city. Unsurprisingly, there has been talk about the cartel moving into the private water racket. In Mexico, if something can be commodified, the cartel runs it.\r\n\r\nSo, Day Zero has already come for many in the city, and for those who have not yet experienced it, the issue is more complicated than a date on a calendar.\r\n\r\nThis theoretical timeline refers specifically to the depletion of the Cutzamala Water System, which draws from neighbouring basins that are currently at approximately 30 percent capacity and provide about 30 percent of the city\u2019s water. But that represents less than a third of the water supply: The rest is in the aquifer directly beneath the city.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat\u2019s really scary is the possibility of Day Zero for the aquifer, because it provides 70 percent of the water we consume,\u201D says Tudela Rivadeneyra. \u201CThat is catastrophe. Right now, people are suffering and it\u2019s not something to take lightly. Thirty percent is like 5 million people \u2013 a quarter of the population of the metropolitan area \u2013 not having enough water\u201D, she says, adding that \u201Cthe aquifer is not replaceable. That is not something you can pull off with water trucks\u201D.\r\n\r\nExperts disagree on how much longer the aquifer can last at current consumption rates, placing the number anywhere between five to 20 years. What is certain is that dramatic action must be taken to avoid a total water disaster.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s like a glass where you sip water every day,\u201D says Tudela Rivadeneyra. \u201CEventually, it will run out.\u201D\r\n\nThe iconic Bellas Artes Palace is sinking to its left. Here, the camera is level and flat but the ground is not [Nick Hilden/Al Jazeera]\nThe need for long-term solutions\n\r\nWhile the city scrambles for quick solutions like water rationing, water trucks, individual conservation advocacy and rain-collecting (collection setups have been distributed to many businesses and homes but only recently, Mexico City saw its first drizzle in months), the crisis has been a long time in the making and solutions cannot happen overnight.\r\n\r\n\u201CThere\u2019s not much that can be done in the short term,\u201D Tudela Rivadeneyra admits, \u201Cbecause there\u2019s not enough time or money for it\u201D. She is more hopeful about longer-term solutions but does not \u201Cthink politicians are being practical about them or investing in them enough\u201D.\r\n\r\nMany significant changes must occur, but according to Solano-Rojas, one of the key adjustments is mental. \u201CWe\u2019re using water thinking it\u2019s a renewable resource,\u201D he says. \u201CWe had this big push against single-use plastic like straws but we still have single-use water.\u201D\r\n\r\nIn addition to pumping in tremendous quantities of fresh water, Mexico City also pumps out the vast majority of its used water as sewage to the nearby state of Hidalgo. This pipeline \u2013 a huge infrastructure undertaking called the Tunel Emisor Oriente \u2013 required substantial resources to build, and critics argue that it exacerbates rather than palliates the water crisis by evacuating water from the city rather than retaining it.\r\n\r\n\u201CWe only treat 15 percent of the water,\u201D says Tudela Rivadeneyra. \u201CThat\u2019s a very low percentage, and almost all of the water we use goes to the sewage. So we\u2019re just importing water and exporting all of the problems without dealing with it locally.\u201D\r\n\nSoldiers place a water treatment plant in San Lorenzo Park in Mexico City, on April 11, 2024. The inhabitants of a sector of Mexico City have been affected by the contamination of a water well with an oily substance, in the midst of an extreme drought that affects several parts of the country [Alfredo Estrella/AFP]\n\r\nWith a presidential election looming, the incumbent Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador\u2019s (AMLO) party, Morena, is desperate to appear to be addressing the growing water emergency. One of its primary proposals involves establishing new water wells in the hardest affected areas, but Tudela Rivadeneyra is doubtful, agreeing that in order to construct actual solutions, there must first be a major shift in mindset.\r\n\r\n\u201CIf we do end up getting all of the water wells, bringing water trucks from wherever we can, from other basins \u2013 people will suffer anyways. The demand is too high,\u201D she explains. \u201CWhat we should be focusing on is what to do next and how to change the way we understand water in the city, and the way that water relates to urban development.\u201D\r\n\nPrivatisation and climate change\n\r\nOne oft-cited contributor to the dearth of water is privatisation. Beer, soft drink, paper and chemical manufacturers have significant operations throughout Mexico City and the adjacent State of Mexico, and are granted enormous water concessions. What water regulations they do face are lax in enforcement or circumvented by corruption.\r\n\r\nExperts note that these water rights can be revoked legally and that a precedent has been set by similar actions taken in the past.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat they should be doing is what they did with the fossil fuel industry,\u201D says Tudela Rivadeneyra. \u201CJust make them go out of the city, because there\u2019s not enough water for them here. They should move to other parts of the country where they have more opportunities to obtain water without drying out the few resources we have.\u201D\r\n\r\nShe\u2019s referring to a plan established by L\u00F3pez Obrador to decentralise the government by relocating Mexico City-based agencies to less populated areas across the country in an effort to ease pollution and infrastructure strain in the megalopolis. While critics have pointed out that this goal was only partially met, it did move the state-owned Pemex petroleum company from its 51-storey tower in the city to the more sparsely populated coast of the state of Campeche, where most of Mexico\u2019s fossil fuels are produced.\r\n\r\nThis sort of decentralisation, emphasises both Solano-Rojas and Tudela Rivadeneyra, is essential to solving the water crisis. Unfortunately, says the latter, relocating water-intensive industry will require prodigious political capital, but there is little willingness to expend it.\r\n\r\nShe notes that while the government has engaged in campaigns to raise awareness for the need for individual responsibility \u2013 shorter showers and the like \u2013 these efforts are not sufficient.\r\n\r\n\u201CBut even if we all did that, it wouldn\u2019t be enough if we still have these concessions,\u201D she says.\r\n\r\nAnd then, of course, there is climate change. On April 15, Mexico City saw its hottest day on record, amid a historic drought.\r\n\r\nRain is essential for renewing the aquifer and leveraging the city\u2019s catchment strategies. In recent years, Mexico City has received less rain but more intense bursts of it. This complicates harvesting because sudden, short-lived eruptions of precipitation require larger gathering surfaces.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, it makes the city more prone to flooding, exacerbated by a lack of open and green spaces that would otherwise allow moisture to seep into the earth.\r\n\r\n\u201CWe should be removing asphalt from parts of the city that don\u2019t really need it, like peripheries,\u201D says Tudela Rivadeneyra.\r\n\r\nAsphalt blocks water seepage, which not only drives flooding but prevents rain from reaching the aquifer. The removal of asphalt is especially important in areas like Iztapalapa, which rests on porous basalt rather than an impervious lake bed like the rest of the city, and may prove vital to replenishing the underground reservoir.\r\n\r\n\u201CWe need to be recharging the aquifer in order to not have a general Day Zero,\u201D Tudela Rivadeneyra emphasises.\r\n\nOn the right of the Metropolitan Cathedral, it is evident that its foundation is sinking [Nick Hilden/Al Jazeera]\nCollective action\n\r\nRecently, it rained in Mexico City for the first time in a long while. This correspondent watched a tiny, very wrinkled elderly woman gaze up at the sky with unguarded delight that verged on relief, her arms spread towards the heavens.\r\n\r\nIf Mexico City is going to overcome this crisis, she and everyone else who lives there \u2013 industrial inhabitants in particular \u2013 will have to change how water is considered.\r\n\r\nAccording to Tudela Rivadeneyra, that means \u201Cfocusing on solutions that have more to do with collectivity. So, instead of having a building just demanding water because it exists, it\u2019s like, what kind of water is it producing? How can we connect it to another building or area that requires that type of water?\u201D\r\n\r\nShe encourages understanding where water originates and where it goeswhy streets become rivers.\r\n\r\n\u201CKnow what\u2019s going on below your feet,\u201D she urges, \u201Cbecause water is very invisible. Making it visible changes the way we relate to it. Dealing with water in different ways that are more circular makes a lot of sense, and it\u2019s not that tough.\u201D\r\n\r\nCan Mexico City achieve the ecosystemic circularity necessary to surmount its water emergency? With the worst yet to come, it seems it is not a matter of can but must.\r\n\nViewed from above, it is difficult to tell, but the iconic Bellas Artes Palace is sinking to its left [Nick Hilden/Al Jazeera]","RSSSummary":"The city faces \u0026#039;Day Zero\u0026#039; as aquifers drain and pipes break.

Brown/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images\r\nMay 11, 2024, 8:00 a.m. ET\r\n\r\nAt the Milken Institute\u2019s Global Conference this week, a little-known risky financial tool became the subject of a hot debate among Wall Street titans.\r\n\r\nMany private equity firms have quietly begun mortgaging their investment funds, piling leverage upon leverage. In other words, they\u2019re taking out loans against the businesses they\u2019ve already taken out loans to buy.\r\n\r\nAt a time when dealmakers are desperate to raise new cash after the boom of the pandemic era, this mechanism \u2014 known as a net asset value loan \u2014 is allowing them to do it overnight.\r\n\r\nMore P.E. firms are using the tool as they set out to raise their next funds, especially those confronting a hurdle during a slow period for dealmaking: They have yet to return cash to the limited partners they tapped for their last round.\r\n\r\n\u201CWe\u2019re having unprecedented pressure from our L.P.s to send them cash,\u201D Jonathan Sokoloff, the founder Leonard Green, said onstage at the Milken conference. \u201CWe\u2019ll send you cash any way we can.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe big debate at Milken was whether private equity firms that are solving this problem with N.A.V.s are risking their future to buy some time with investors.\r\n\r\nHow N.A.V. loans work. Offered by banks and some smaller private credit-focused lenders, they are backed by the net asset value of select P.E. firms\u2019 investments. They have a higher interest rate than other forms of private equity lending, which appeals to lenders.\r\n\r\nThere is about $150 billion in N.A.V. facilities on the market today, according to the ratings agency S\u0026P Global. It expects that figure to double in the next two years. Investor liquidity is only one use of the loans, which are often invested back into portfolio companies.\r\n\r\nLenders say they offer the loans cautiously. \u201CWhen we come and lend to the portfolio, the fund will be in Year 4 or 5,\u201D Pierre-Antoine de Selancy, a co-founder of the private equity financing firm 17Capital, told DealBook. \u201CWe have a very good source of information.\u201D\r\n\r\nLenders and advisers who work on N.A.V. loans say they are generally structured to minimize risk, with short durations of two or three years and a low loan-to-value ratio, a measure that compares an asset\u2019s estimated value with the size of the loan. Loans against diversified assets can be safer than ones against an individual company because the risk is spread. That can also mean better loan terms.\r\n\r\nBut the danger is leveraging an illiquid asset. The private equity business model relies on taking out debt against each of a fund\u2019s businesses. But N.A.V. loans are most often borrowing against a group of businesses. That diversifies the risk, but it could effectively mean using a good business to help prop up a bad one, while also adding increasingly expensive leverage to an already leveraged fund.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt introduces a greater degree of risk,\u201D Patricia Lynch, who leads the securitization practice at the law firm Ropes \u0026 Gray, told DealBook.\r\n\r\nThe quality of these loans depends in part on a private equity firm\u2019s ability to accurately calculate the value of its businesses (often with the stamp of a third-party appraiser). If the loans sour, it is not fast or easy to sell those assets.\r\n\r\nLimited partners have limited recourse. Many of their agreements with private equity firms were written before N.A.V. loans were in vogue, which means these loans may be technically allowed, if not explicitly. But executives at several large pension funds who spoke to DealBook on the condition of anonymity, because they were not authorized to comment on behalf of their firms, said they had told P.E. firms that they had concerns about using N.A.V. loans for distributions. Others, like Neuberger Berman, take a measured approach.\r\n\r\n\u201CThe general sentiment is: Why are you using them?\u201D Liz Traxler, a managing director at Neuberger Berman, said. \u201CIf you have transparency on the usage, and that aligns with the L.P.s, things are probably going to be very positive.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe worst-case scenario \u2014 that P.E. firms default on their N.A.V. loans \u2014 may be unlikely, but it is an untested risk that could hurt the very investors whom private equity firms are trying to appease in the first place. As Anne-Marie Fink, the chief investment officer of the State of Wisconsin Investment Board, put it onstage at Milken: \u201CIf I get a little bit back now, but you\u2019ve levered the whole fund and I\u2019m cross-collateralized all through a N.A.V. loan, and I eventually lose my money, that\u2019s not a good way for me to get my money back.\u201D \u2014 Lauren Hirsch\r\nIN CASE YOU MISSED IT\r\nTikTok sued to block a law that could force its sale. The company argues that the recently passed law \u2014 which requires the app to split from ByteDance, its Chinese owner, or face a ban \u2014 violates the First Amendment by effectively killing in the United States an app that millions of Americans use to share their views. The heart of the case is lawmakers\u2019 intent to defend the nation from what they and some experts say is a security threat.\r\n\r\nFTX said it planned to repay all its customers. It will base their reimbursement on what they were owed as of November 2022, when the cryptocurrency exchange filed for bankruptcy, plus interest. The customers won\u2019t benefit from the huge jump in crypto prices since then.\r\n\r\nMore drama unfolded around a Paramount deal. If Sony Pictures Entertainment and Apollo Global Management succeed in the $26 billion acquisition they\u2019ve expressed interest in, they plan to break up the media empire, DealBook\u2019s Lauren Hirsch and The New York Times\u2019s Ben Mullin reported. In other potential breakup news, T-Mobile and Verizon are said to be in talks that would divvy up U.S. Cellular, according to The Wall Street Journal.\r\n\r\nU.S. authorities are reportedly examining Tesla\u2019s claims about its Autopilot feature. The inquiry by federal prosecutors centers on whether Elon Musk\u2019s electric carmaker committed securities or wire fraud by suggesting its cars can drive themselves, when its systems require human supervision, according to Reuters. It may again raise the question: Is it fraud, or is it puffery?\r\n\u2018Fun-flation,\u2019 Taylor\u2019s version\r\nEurope has finally gotten in on Taylor Swift\u2019s record-breaking Eras Tour \u2014 and the economic bonanza that seems to come with it.\r\n\r\nThe billion-dollar tour began in Europe on Thursday in Paris\u2019s 40,000-seat La D\u00E9fense arena, before moving on to Stockholm, London, Amsterdam and other major cities through August.\r\n\r\nSwift\u2019s shows appear to have inspired tourists to hit Europe. Americans who missed out last summer at home are taking advantage of a strong dollar, with tickets costing less on the other side of the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nAirbnb rentals are up in the cities hosting concerts. Airbtics, which tracks data on Airbnb rentals, found a sharp uptick in bookings for several European stops on the Eras Tour. In Paris, rental occupancy jumped to nearly 100 percent on Thursday, up from 73 percent a week earlier. Milan, Munich, Vienna and Warsaw saw similar patterns, according to Airbtics. When European tickets went on sale in July, searches for Airbnb rentals in London, Edinburgh, Cardiff and Liverpool during concert dates increased an average 337 percent for show nights, compared with searches for those dates the previous month, according to Airbnb.\r\n\r\nImage\r\nCredit...The New York Times\r\nSome economists expect the Eras Tour to be the first boost for a busy European summer of events. Holger Schmieding, the Berenberg economist who coined the term \u201Cfun-flation\u201D to describe how consumers were splashing out despite high inflation last year, predicts the trend will continue in Europe in 2024. Swift\u2019s tour is one of several big events on the continent, including the UEFA European soccer championship, which starts in Germany next month, and the Summer Olympics, which open in Paris in July.\r\n\r\nHouseholds in Europe may have even more spending firepower than last year. Food and fuel inflation is moderating more rapidly than in the United States, and interest rates could start coming down as soon as next month. \u201CThis summer, we will in Europe have significant further gains in the purchasing power of consumers,\u201D Schmieding told DealBook.\r\nWhat the NFT boom (and bust) says about the dark side of the art market\r\nRemember NFTs? Briefly during the pandemic, the nonfungible tokens generated countless headlines and billions in sales. Now, while other crypto assets are soaring, that market is down to mere millions, and former President Donald Trump is using NFTs to raise campaign funds. But the boom illuminated dark corners of the art market and economy, the Times reporter Zachary Small writes in \u201CToken Supremacy: The Art of Finance, the Finance of Art, and the Great Crypto Crash of 2022.\u201D DealBook spoke with Small about the upcoming book.\r\n\r\nWhat did the emergence of NFTs reveal about the art market?\r\n\r\nThey shed light onto the speculation and laundering that happen in the art market all the time. Sales of NFTs are recorded through the blockchain, so we could see prices in real time as they were changing and deduce what was happening. There was a lot of wash trading, where someone had set up two wallets under different signatures and was trading back and forth to elevate the price of a work until some unsuspecting rube bought into it because they thought it was doing well. Some experts and analysts say that ended up being a significant portion of the market.\r\n\r\nSo should the art market be regulated more like the stock market?\r\n\r\nThe art market is often referred to as the largest unregulated market in the world. You have paintings trading for hundreds of millions of dollars. But the Bank Secrecy Act does not apply, so it\u2019s very easy to use shell companies. Buyers don\u2019t know sellers. Oligarchs have been very successful in using art advisers as patsies and in moving money. But federal regulators have a fundamental difficulty with the art market because it doesn\u2019t seem serious. How do you put a price on art, and who cares? It\u2019s a champagne problem for billionaires.\r\n\r\nNFTs adopted a very similar approach. It\u2019s a genius approach to create things that look ridiculous so regulators feel they don\u2019t really need to step in. From my reporting, that\u2019s a very deliberate strategy on the part of companies and investors to avoid regulation, and it\u2019s worked.\r\n\r\nWhat does the NFT boom tell us about the future?\r\n\r\nWhat\u2019s most urgent to me is that if you want to know how the 20- and 30-year-olds think about the economy, you need to know what they were doing in the NFT and crypto world. I think this acceptance of volatility and speculation as we\u2019ve all lived through the interest rates changing and inflation and all the other economic red flags, it creates a system where speculation and volatility are more accepted. It makes it harder for regulators to safeguard the system.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading! We\u2019ll see you Monday.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019d like your feedback.

But last month, the long-running shadow war between the two nations burst into the open in a series of unprecedented drone and missile strikes, raising the specter of a fight that would contain enough advanced technology, paramilitary forces and mutual acrimony to incinerate large parts of the Middle East, collapse the global economy and entangle the United States and other major powers.\r\n\r\nNow the two sides appear to have hit pause, but for how long? As long as Iran is ruled by an Islamist government that puts its revolutionary ideology before the national interest, the two countries will never know peace, and the Middle East will never know meaningful stability.\r\n\r\nIran and Israel are not natural adversaries. In contrast to other modern conflicts \u2014 between Israel and Palestine, Russia and Ukraine, China and Taiwan \u2014 Iran and Israel have no bilateral land or resource disputes. Their national strengths \u2014 Iran is an energy titan and Israel is a tech innovator \u2014 are more complementary than competitive. The nations also have a historical affinity dating back over 2,500 years, when the Persian King Cyrus the Great freed the Jews from the Babylonian Captivity. Iran was the second Muslim nation, after Turkey, to recognize Israel after its founding in 1948.\r\n\r\nTheir modern animosity is best understood through the lens of ideology, not geopolitics. It began with the rise of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the dogmatic Shiite cleric who led the 1979 revolution that transformed Iran from a U.S.-allied monarchy into an anti-American theocracy. Khomeini\u2019s 1970 treatise \u201CIslamic Government,\u201D which became the basis of the constitution that governs the Islamic Republic, is laced with tirades and threats against \u201Cwretched\u201D and \u201Csatanic\u201D Jews. Then, as now, antisemitism often lurked below the surface of anti-imperialism.\r\n\r\n\u201CWe must protest and make the people aware that the Jews and their foreign backers are opposed to the very foundations of Islam and wish to establish Jewish domination throughout the world,\u201D Khomeini wrote. \u201CSince they are a cunning and resourceful group of people, I fear that \u2014 God forbid \u2014 they may one day achieve their goal and that the apathy shown by some of us may allow a Jew to rule over us one day.\u201D\r\n\r\nIn the same manifesto, Khomeini casually advocates what in modern parlance is best understood as ethnic cleansing. \u201CIslam,\u201D he wrote, \u201Chas rooted out numerous groups that were a source of corruption and harm to human society.\u201D He went on to cite the case of a \u201Ctroublesome\u201D Jewish tribe in Medina that he said was \u201Celiminated\u201D by the Prophet Muhammad.\r\n\r\nVery few of the Iranian revolutionaries and Western progressives who backed Khomeini in 1979 \u2014 some of whom compared him with Mohandas K. Gandhi \u2014 had bothered to scrutinize his vision for Iran. Once in power, he built his newfound theocracy on three ideological pillars: death to America, death to Israel and the subjugation of women.\r\n\r\nOver four decades later, the worldview of Iran\u2019s current rulers has evolved little. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Khomeini\u2019s 85-year-old successor and now one of the world\u2019s longest-serving dictators, denounces Zionism in virtually every speech and was one of the few world leaders to publicly praise Hamas\u2019s \u201Cepic\u201D Oct. 7 attack on Israel. \u201CWe will support and assist any nation or any group anywhere,\u201D Ayatollah Khamenei said in 2020, \u201Cwho opposes and fights the Zionist regime.\u201D\r\n\r\nAs Ayatollah Khamenei\u2019s words make plain, the Islamic Republic of Iran is one of the few governments in the world more dedicated to abolishing another nation than advancing its own. \u201CDeath to Israel\u201D is the regime\u2019s rallying cry \u2014 not \u201CLong live Iran.\u201D\r\n\r\nAyatollah Khamenei\u2019s regime has backed this language with action. Iran has spent tens of billions of dollars arming, training and financing proxy militias in five failing nations: Lebanon, Syria, Gaza, Iraq and Yemen. Together these groups constitute its so-called Axis of Resistance against America and Israel. These groups are elbow-deep in corruption and repression in their own societies, including illicit drug dealing and piracy, while pledging that they seek justice for Palestinians.\r\n\r\nHostility toward Israel is a useful tool for predominantly Shiite, Persian Iran to vie for leadership in the predominantly Sunni, Arab Middle East. But it should not be confused with concern for the well-being of Palestinians. In contrast to American, European and Arab governments that fund Palestinian human welfare initiatives, Iran has poured hundreds of millions of dollars into arming and financing Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad. Iran\u2019s goal is not to build a Palestine but to demolish Israel.\r\n\r\nAnd yet as much as the Islamic Republic is committed to its ideology, it is even more committed to staying in power. As the German American philosopher Hannah Arendt once put it, \u201CThe most radical revolutionary will become a conservative on the day after the revolution.\u201D As its careful response to Israel\u2019s recent military strikes on Iran showed, when faced with the possibility of full-blown war or existential economic pressure, Tehran tactically retreats.\r\n\r\nAfter decades of living under an economically failing, socially repressive police state, Iran\u2019s people long ago recognized that the greatest obstacle between themselves and a normal life is their own leadership, not America or Israel. In a 2021 public opinion poll conducted from Europe, only around one-fifth of Iranians approved of their government\u2019s support of Hamas and \u201CDeath to Israel\u201D slogan. Few nations have Iran\u2019s combination of natural resource wealth, human capital, geographic size and ancient history. This enormous gap between Iran\u2019s potential and its citizens\u2019 reality is one reason the country has experienced numerous mass uprisings over the past two decades.\r\n\r\nIran\u2019s Axis of Resistance has empowered right-wing Israeli politicians far more than Palestinians over the past two decades. The threat of a Holocaust-denying Iranian regime with regional and nuclear ambitions has stoked Israeli anxieties, diverted attention from Palestinian suffering and facilitated normalization agreements between Israel and Arab governments equally fearful of Iran. Indeed, Iran and its proxies were such a useful adversary that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu helped prop up Hamas\u2019s rule in Gaza until the deadly attacks of Oct. 7.\r\n\r\n\u201CThe dream of Israeli leaders,\u201D a retired Israeli general, Amos Yadlin, told me recently, \u201Cis to one day restore normal relations with an Iranian government.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe dream of Iran\u2019s Islamist leaders, on the other hand, is to end Israel\u2019s existence. Israel\u2019s conflict with Iran has been a war of necessity, but Iran\u2019s conflict with Israel has been a war of choice. It won\u2019t be over until Iran has leaders who put Iranians\u2019 interests over Israel\u2019s destruction.\r\n\r\nA version of this article appears in print on , Section\r\n\r\nSR\r\n\r\n, Page\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\nof the New York edition\r\n\r\nwith the headline:\r\n\r\nIran and Israel Weren\u2019t Always Enemies.

He\u2019s Made Many.\r\n\r\nCredit...Kannetha Brown for The New York Times\r\nMay 8, 2024\r\nGlenn Loury thought maybe the world \u2014 maybe he \u2014 had been wrong about Derek Chauvin, the police officer convicted of murdering George Floyd in 2020. Loury had watched a documentary, \u201CThe Fall of Minneapolis,\u201D that had circulated largely on right-wing social media, arguing that Chauvin had been wrongly convicted, and found himself persuaded. Was it possible, he wondered, that Floyd had actually died of a drug overdose?\r\n\r\nFloyd\u2019s death had ignited protests nationwide and spurred a passionate national debate about racism that often left Loury, a prominent Black conservative, at odds with many other Black intellectuals and with much of the American left.\r\n\r\nHe welcomed the film\u2019s creators, Liz Collin and JC Chaix, as guests on his podcast, \u201CThe Glenn Show,\u201D which has over 100,000 subscribers on YouTube.\r\n\r\nThe blowback was swift and harsh.\r\n\r\n\u201CReally, you\u2019re going to take Chauvin\u2019s side?\u201D friends emailed Loury. Commenters on his newsletter and social media also took issue. Then Radley Balko, an independent journalist, published a long and meticulous critique of the film, calling it \u201Call nonsense.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CFrankly, I felt exposed,\u201D Loury told me. We were sitting by the fireplace of his living room on a chilly April afternoon in Providence, R.I., where he is a professor at Brown University. \u201CI felt that my integrity could potentially be called into question.\u201D He needed to \u201Ccome clean.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI pride myself on remaining open to evidence and reason, even if they disconfirm something I had formerly thought to be true,\u201D Loury wrote in a mea culpa for his Substack, calling his error egregious. That weekend, he had Minnesota\u2019s attorney general, Keith Ellison, who oversaw the prosecution of Chauvin in the Floyd case, on his podcast, to hear the other side of the story.\r\n\r\nHow had he made such a mistake?\r\n\r\n\u201CThe real story is I hated what happened in the summer of 2020,\u201D he told me. \u201CI think these moral panics we have around these police killings are over the top and it\u2019s bad for the country.\u201D He had supported the filmmakers, he confessed, because they were attacking people he opposed. \u201CI let that cloud my judgment.\u201D\r\n\r\nThis is far from the first reversal, political or personal, for Loury, 75, one of the most celebrated and reviled Black intellectuals of the past half-century. While public debate has too often devolved into lobbing grenades from entrenched positions, Loury\u2019s tumultuous life, his swings from the right to the left and back again, his remarkable, barrier-busting successes and his considerable frailties and failures, have taught him to always recognize that he could be wrong and to keep an open mind, no matter how vehement his opinions. He outlines this ragged road to wisdom in his remarkably candid memoir, \u201CLate Admissions: Confessions of a Black Conservative.\u201D\r\n\u2018The Enemy Within\u2019\r\nThe name Glenn Loury often appears on lists of prominent conservative Black figures like Thomas Sowell, Clarence Thomas and Shelby Steele. He was a star Ph.D. graduate in economics from M.I.T. and the first Black tenured professor of economics at Harvard. He was a darling of the neoconservative movement and was tapped to be deputy secretary of education during the Reagan administration.\r\n\r\nBut that was before he was charged with assaulting his ex-mistress. Before he was arrested for drug possession. Before he was exposed as both a serial philanderer and a crack addict. He\u2019d left two daughters from his first marriage back in Chicago; he barely acknowledged a son born to a former girlfriend, until the son was fully grown.\r\n\r\nA 1995 New Yorker profile described Loury\u2019s first public downfall thus: \u201CLoury was emerging as exactly the kind of person he had warned Black America to avoid: a violent, irresponsible, drug-using womanizer who put his own pleasure above the demands of his career and the needs of his family.\u201D\r\n\r\nIn recounting all that\u2019s happened since, \u201CLate Admissions\u201D does something that is rare in fiction but almost unheard-of in memoir: It presents both an unlikable and an unreliable narrator.\r\n\r\nIn an unusual introduction, Loury explains that he hopes to build trust with the reader by exposing his obfuscations and prevarications, warding off anything terrible a reader might say about him by saying it all, himself, first. One title he considered for the book, he told me, was \u201CThe Enemy Within.\u201D\r\n\r\nLoury was born in 1948 on the South Side of Chicago. The early childhood scenes in the memoir evoke a close-knit slice of Black working-class life in Park Manor following the Great Migration, a place of honest jobs and not-quite-honest side hustles, to which even his strait-laced Aunt Eloise occasionally turned a blind eye.\r\n\r\nDespite early success in school, by the time Loury was 19, he had dropped out of college, had two children with a high school crush (they eventually married and divorced) and was working at a printing plant.\r\n\r\nIt was only at community college, when a professor recognized his promise and urged him to apply to Northwestern, that Loury turned his life around. After he got a Ph.D. in economics from M.I.T., his rise was meteoric, eventually leading to a dual appointment in economics and Afro-American studies at Harvard in 1982.\r\n\u2018Who Have I Become?\u2019\r\nIn his 1976 dissertation at M.I.T., Loury pioneered a concept of \u201Csocial capital\u201D that became hugely influential. Loury showed that in the labor market, success isn\u2019t predicted purely on the basis of intelligence and skills but also on networks and connections: social capital. These differences, he argued, apart from legal discrimination or racism, often explain racial disparities in the work force.\r\n\r\nIt is a paradox of Loury\u2019s career, then, that he has repeatedly built up and then destroyed his own social capital. His working-class background led him to bristle at some of the assumptions of the Black intelligentsia, particularly the idea that Black people didn\u2019t play a hand in their own circumstances. He resented what he saw as the presumption of a singular liberal opinion among the Black establishment.\r\n\r\nBut at Harvard, Loury, long a critic of affirmative action, couldn\u2019t help but worry he might be there as its beneficiary. The fear that his colleagues doubted his abilities led him to seriously doubt them himself, and he buckled under the pressure, real and imagined. He stopped doing economics research. He hid in his office in the Afro-American studies department.\r\n\r\n\u201CI choked,\u201D he told me. \u201CI wasn\u2019t sure I was good enough.\u201D At the peak of his scholarly performance, he quit the field and took a job at the Harvard Kennedy School where he assumed a busy life of freelance writing, public speaking and conferences.\r\n\r\nImage\r\nA few of the books in Loury\u2019s home office.Credit...Kannetha Brown for The New York Times\r\nImage\r\nLoury working at his desk.Credit...Kannetha Brown for The New York Times\r\nWhen he began publicly criticizing the civil rights movement, he was embraced by the burgeoning neoconservative movement. The intellectual set behind Commentary magazine courted his contributions and he became part of the same circles as Jack Kemp, William Kristol and Norman Podhoretz. He became friendly with Clarence Thomas. He relished their appreciation of his point of view.\r\n\r\nBut in the \u201990s, three popular conservative books on race led him to break with the right: \u201CThe Bell Curve\u201D by Charles Murray and Richard J. Hernstein, which posited a relationship between intelligence and race; \u201CThe End of Racism: Principles for a Multiracial Society,\u201D an incendiary polemic by Dinesh D\u2019Souza; and \u201CAmerica in Black and White: One Nation, Indivisible,\u201D by his friends at Harvard Abigail and Stephan Thernstrom. After he wrote a scathing review of \u201CThe End of Racism\u201D for The Weekly Standard, The Standard published a long rebuttal from D\u2019Souza in the next issue.\r\n\r\nKristol, a former editor of The Weekly Standard, says Loury\u2019s criticism of those books looks good in retrospect. \u201CHe was warier of them that most of us were, to his credit,\u201D Kristol told me. \u201CLoury could have had a pretty easy path to being a famous Black conservative, and he didn\u2019t do that. I kind of respect him for not being one, to be honest.\u201D\r\n\r\nLoury had opposed the politics of the civil rights leadership, rejected affirmative action and thought that behavioral problems in poor Black communities posed a more serious obstacle to progress than discrimination. But in these writers he saw a callousness and even a disdain for Black people.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt made me wonder, who are these people I\u2019m in bed with?\u201D he said to me. \u201CWho am I? Who have I become?\u201D\r\n\u2018I Was Really Broken\u2019\r\nOne through line persisted through all these political rifts. Loury had been living a double life, one that in many ways felt to him more authentic to his urban roots: the life of \u201Cthe player,\u201D a mythic ideal he based largely on his uncle Alfred, a man who fathered 22 children by four women.\r\n\r\nWherever he\u2019d travel, he\u2019d visit the local alleys and bars, playing pickup chess and picking up women, sometimes prostitutes. All the while, he was married to his second wife, Linda, an academic at Tufts, \u201Ctaking this wonderful woman and dragging her through the mud and taking advantage of her, exploiting her fidelity and her patience,\u201D as he put it to me, his voice strained. (Linda died of cancer in 2011.)\r\n\r\nAfter getting arrested in 1987 for domestic abuse of his 23-year-old mistress (the charges were dropped when she stopped cooperating with prosecutors), Loury, then 39, sank into crack addiction, after a prostitute casually introduced him to the drug. Another arrest and two stints in rehab later, Loury entered yet another Black enclave, the Black evangelical church. In the early months of recovery, he was born again.\r\n\r\n\u201CI came into the church on my hands and knees,\u201D he told me. \u201CI mean, I was really broken.\u201D\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s as if Loury repeatedly plays a game of tug of war, with himself and with the wider world. His yearning to belong countered by a suspicion of belonging. Why do you want me here? What purpose am I serving, and is it one I want to carry out?\r\n\r\nThis helps account for his \u201Clurching from left to right to left to right,\u201D the fear of being seen as a token rather than as an \u201Ceconomist who happened to be Black,\u201D and the deeper fear of actually being one.\r\n\r\nIn the late \u201990s and in a decisive and very public move to the left, he started writing about policing and race. He took up mass incarceration \u2014 \u201Cbefore Michelle Alexander!\u201D \u2014 as his main cause and decamped from Harvard to Boston University, where he created the Institute on Race and Social Division. Soon enough, Henry Louis Gates Jr. invited him to give the coveted W.E.B. Du Bois Lectures at Harvard in 2002. For the first time, the Black intellectual establishment opened its doors to him, occasionally with warmth. It felt \u201Cdamn good,\u201D he said.\r\n\r\nAnd then once again that feeling of affirmation started to dissipate.\r\n\r\nWhat bothered him about the left was its evasions, assumptions and methods in addressing issues of racial inequality. What bothered him about the right was that it didn\u2019t seem to share his goal of addressing racial inequality at all.\r\n\r\nThrough all his political shifts, Loury has been consistent in his abiding concern for Black Americans. He believes there are serious problems in Black educational achievement and Black economic, social and health outcomes. The collapse of family, the spread of gangs.\r\n\r\n\u201CThere\u2019s something rotten there, there\u2019s something problematic there, there\u2019s a deep, deep, deep something amiss there,\u201D he said. \u201CAnd I want to say it\u2019s not just them, it\u2019s not just on them, it\u2019s us.\u201D He wants to talk about agency, choice, responsibility.\r\n\r\n\u201CI can\u2019t even look at you in the eye when I\u2019m saying this!\u201D he exclaimed suddenly, interrupting himself. \u201CBecause it\u2019s so hard to say. I mean, it is blaming the victim at some level.\u201D\r\n\r\nI asked Loury: If not affirmative action, if not D.E.I., then what\u2019s the solution? He hesitated, then talked about early childhood education, school reform, investments in mental health, tools to develop the potential of Black families and communities.\r\n\r\nAt heart, he still believes in what he calls \u201Cthe Booker T. Washington-slash-Clarence Thomas\u201D idea that slavery was horrible, but it\u2019s over. Between what he calls the two polar paths to Black progress, W.E.B. DuBois, who emphasized equality and integration with white America, and Washington, who emphasized separatism and self-sufficiency, he falls on the pull-yourself-up-by-your-bootstraps side.\r\n\r\n\u201CWe\u2019re not supposed to talk about out-of-wedlock births. That\u2019s pass\u00E9,\u201D he said. \u201CBut I don\u2019t believe that for a minute!\u201D When 70 to 80 percent of kids are brought up without fathers, he said, \u201CHow\u2019s that not the death knell for the healthy reproduction of social life? How is that not the end? And what I see is excuse making. The artful changing of the subject.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWe need to get busy,\u201D he said. \u201CYou have to stand up.\u201D\r\n\r\nBut he\u2019s still got to check himself. Maybe he\u2019s wrong. His wife of seven years, LaJuan, is strongly committed to her progressive beliefs. Their marriage, he said, has \u201Chad far-reaching implications for my own intellectual life.\u201D Together they listen to the left-wing podcasts she favors: \u201CThe Jimmy Dore Show,\u201D \u201CMax Blumenthal,\u201D \u201CDue Dissidence.\u201D Not only is he exposed to different ideas, but out of his respect for his wife, he has to \u201Cself-interrogate a bit.\u201D\r\n\u2018I Am a Fallen Man\u2019\r\nLoury remains a hugely popular economics professor at Brown, where he has taught largely progressive students since 2005. His classes are always oversubscribed, especially now that he has announced plans to retire next year. In recent years he has taught a class on free inquiry in the modern world, which he developed with an undergrad who told him he was sick of people not saying what they really thought.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s maybe the most gratifying teaching experience I\u2019ve had in my career,\u201D he told me. \u201CBecause we tackle the cancel-culture-political-correctness conundrum.\u201D\r\n\r\nLast semester, Loury co-taught a class on race, crime and justice in America. Former students told me they relish the open debate they find in his classroom. \u201CAt times it could get a little heated,\u201D Ayla Kim, a junior, said. \u201CBut it generated a lot of thought. I felt more informed on particular issues hearing multiple sides.\u201D\r\n\r\nHenry Mass, a senior, told me: \u201CIt\u2019s pretty unique and refreshing to get to hear a deviation from the standard opinion in college, it\u2019s sad to say. You\u2019re meant to nod your head and conform in other classes. But this was really cool. We were allowed to argue on a number of hot-button issues, whether it was police abolition or affirmative action.\u201D The students I spoke with all loved the class.\r\n\r\nLoury hopes to continue teaching after retirement, even without pay. He\u2019d like to take up piano. He plans to continue his podcast, having just constructed a new studio in his basement. These projects excite him in a way contemporary politics do not. Loury still doesn\u2019t know whom he\u2019ll vote for this fall, but he knows he won\u2019t vote for President Biden; he says he\u2019ll probably abstain or vote for his friend Cornel West. That\u2019s where his free-market conservatism comes in and his distrust of \u201Cthe liberal Democratic cognoscenti,\u201D which he finds patronizing. \u201CMuch of the D.E.I. initiative backed by Biden is little more than pandering with irrelevant concessions to an elite wing of the Black Democratic establishment,\u201D he explained.\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019m terrified for the future of this country,\u201D he told me. \u201CNobody trusts anybody anymore. I fear that seeds of dissension have been sown that will bear a bitter fruit down the line, so I\u2019m finding it hard to be optimistic.\u201D\r\n\r\nHe also worries about the publication of \u201CLate Admissions,\u201D which comes out on Tuesday. He knows some people will be \u201Cgunning\u201D for him because they find his politics despicable; that\u2019s not what bothers him.\r\n\r\nWhat he does fear is that students and friends will form negative opinions of him. His two adult daughters by his first wife have read the book. \u201CAnd they are not happy campers,\u201D he said slowly. A close friend read it and said to Loury, \u201CI don\u2019t know if I like that guy,\u201D to which Loury responded, \u201CI don\u2019t know if I like him either.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI am a fallen man,\u201D he told me, repeating a phrase that appears near the end of the book. \u201CI cannot defeat the enemy within, not entirely.\u201D\r\n\r\nPamela Paul is an Opinion columnist at The Times, writing about culture, politics, ideas and the way we live now.\r\n\r\nA version of this article appears in print on , Section\r\n\r\nSR\r\n\r\n, Page\r\n\r\n12\r\n\r\nof the New York edition\r\n\r\nwith the headline:\r\n\r\nOne Black Conservative Continues to Stand Apart.

Where are the fully realized babies in fiction? I wasn\u2019t after infants who are incidental to the plot; I wanted babies whose babyhood was essential to the story.\r\n\r\nI shouldn\u2019t be surprised by this itch. It has been the year of the baby for my loved ones. Blink, and a friend\u2019s little bundle of semi-consciousness has grown to the size of a koala. What\u2019s going on in there, little guy?\r\n\r\nLook, babies freak me out. Whenever I\u2019m around them I worry about doing something that will forever alter their lives, like holding a bottle at the wrong angle or making curse words sound cool. But I don\u2019t see them exiting my life any time soon, and this is an irrational, unbiological fear that I\u2019d like to overcome. Enter literary exposure therapy.\r\n\r\nMy holy grail? A bouncing, gurgling Chekhov\u2019s gun. If a baby appears in the first act, I expect it to start crawling by the last. I\u2019m pleased to share the results of my spelunking: a can-do, women-run novel from Barbara Kingsolver and a deeply weird, overlooked British story that puts a baby\u2019s existence into grotesquely brilliant prose. The children are our future; teach them well and let them lead the way.\r\n\r\n\u2014Joumana\r\n\u201CThe Bean Trees,\u201D by Barbara Kingsolver\r\nFiction, 1988\r\n\r\nOf course Barbara Kingsolver, She Who Treats All Her Characters With Dignity, has a memorable baby in her universe. She unfurls the same expansive humanity across each of her books, including this, her debut.\r\n\r\nMeet Taylor Greer, daughter of Pittman County, Ky. More important, she\u2019s the daughter of a single mother who believed Taylor hung the moon and \u201Cplugged in all the stars.\u201D Taylor dreams of more for herself than what her small hometown could offer \u2014 a life of babies and tobacco farms and not much else. When she has enough saved to buy a \u201955 Volkswagen (with no windows, no back seat and no starter, mind you), she heads West.\r\n\r\nAfter a verbal tussle with a cowboy in Oklahoma \u2014 a careless pass of a diner ketchup bottle sloshes out a few cents\u2019 worth of coffee from Taylor\u2019s mug, a scene that will be achingly familiar to anyone who\u2019s robbed Peter to pay Paul \u2014 a Native woman gives Taylor a young child and disappears. The woman who left Kentucky to avoid motherhood now has a mute little girl she knows nothing about as her charge.\r\n\r\nShe names her Turtle, on account of how tightly the child clings to her. \u201CI think it would have been easier to separate me from my hair,\u201D she thinks. Appropriately, Turtle is slow to show herself, and for heartbreaking reason.\r\n\r\nTaylor\u2019s worldliness dilates quickly once she and Turtle reach Tucson, their eventual home. She has big Erin Brockovich energy, and a sense of humor: Scanning rental listings in the local paper, \u201CI began to suspect that sharing harmonious space with an insightful Virgo might require even greater credentials than being a licensed phlebotomist in the state of Arizona.\u201D\r\n\r\nSome of Taylor\u2019s wit and mettle recede as the story aims for a bigger message. There\u2019s a secondary plot involving migrants seeking a sanctuary of their own, just as mother and daughter ease into their adopted city. But that unexpected maternal love is a constant, and it\u2019s a pleasure that Turtle is much more than a foil to Taylor or the catalyst for Taylor\u2019s coming-of-age; she\u2019s a loving and resilient child, and memorable in her own right.\r\n\r\nRead if you like: The movie \u201CMask,\u201D heritage seed catalogs, \u201C9 to 5\u201D\r\nAvailable from: The library, probably your mom\u2019s bookshelf, a well-stocked motel lobby\r\n\u201CLord Jim at Home,\u201D by Dinah Brooke\r\nFiction, 1973 (reissued 2023)\r\n\r\nWhat a startling, disorienting book. You read it in a stupor, much as babies go through their earliest days. I\u2019m glad the author wrote it before retreating to an ashram in Maharashtra; I loved it.\r\n\r\nWe are in Cornwall between world wars. Nestled in a posh cliffside home are the King, the Queen and their little Prince, a mewling infant whom we get to know through his senses.\r\n\r\n\u201CThe Prince lies in his mother\u2019s lap. He is good. The sun is balmy on his face. The fears of the dark cupboard have shrunk to the size of an old man wrapped in a dark fringed rug.\u201D (Imagine if babies had this sort of language available to them!)\r\n\r\nBut this is no idyll. The Prince lives for moments with his mother, away from his rigid, starchy nurse, when he is fed \u201Ckisses and licks of sugar.\u201D Here comes the melodrama \u2014 \u201Cthe exquisite pain, torn away from this tender sweetness, fingers clutching, body arched, screams of despair. Even a rat would have learned that a broken string of pearls and knocked over teacup meant that next day there would be no love, no sugar. The Prince learns in the end, but a rat would have learned sooner.\u201D\r\n\r\nThese early ruptures are nauseating to read, however modish such tactics of deprivation and discipline were at the time. And yet they\u2019re essential to the story, which follows the boy to school, the Navy and beyond. Privilege and torture create the firmament of his selfhood. We cannot understand this individual \u2014 and his ultimate acts of horror \u2014 without having peered down at him from the bars of his crib.\r\n\r\nYou don\u2019t need to have read Joseph Conrad\u2019s 1900 novel \u201CLord Jim\u201D to appreciate this book, but it\u2019s a useful referent. (Quickly, in case you\u2019ve lost your seminar notes: \u201CLord Jim\u201D follows a sailor who makes a cowardly decision at sea, and tries to outrun the consequences; the Book Review called it a \u201Cstudy of a soul.\u201D)\r\n\r\nThis, too, is an explicit call to judge an ambiguous, passive, coolly voided man, resulting in a soup-to-nuts character study that is less \u201CFrank Sinatra Has a Cold\u201D than \u201CRobert Mugabe Has a Migraine.\u201D\r\n\r\nRead if you like: voir dire, Shelley Duvall\u2019s Faerie Tale Theatre, pedagogical debates, Mother\u2019s wedding china\r\nAvailable from: Luckily for us, McNally Editions released this for the first time in the United States last year, so most major book retailers will carry it; otherwise, Anglophiles might be peddling first editions wherever used books are sold\r\nWhy don\u2019t you \u2026\r\nTake heed of Alice McDermott\u2019s writing wisdom, conveniently collected in \u201CWhat About the Baby?\u201D\r\n\r\nAcquaint yourself with some of my favorite children in recent fiction, courtesy of Camille Bordas?\r\n\r\nTour a school to send your baby to, run by Donald Barthelme?\r\n\r\nThank you for being a subscriber\r\n\r\nPlunge further into books at The New York Times or our reading recommendations.\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019re enjoying what you\u2019re reading, please consider recommending it to others.

He had failed to perform at two dress rehearsals on Friday, and contest organizer the European Broadcasting Union said it was investigating an \u201Cincident.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe EBU said Swedish police were investigating \u201Ca complaint made by a female member of the production crew\u201D and it would not be appropriate for Klein to participate while the legal process was underway.\r\n\r\nThough rumors had been flying the incident was connected to Israel\u0027s delegation, organizers said the incident \u201Cdid not involve any other performer or delegation member.\u201D\r\n\r\nThough the contest\u2019s motto is \u201Cunited by music,\u201D this year\u2019s event has attracted large protests from Palestinians and their supporters, who say Israel should be excluded because of its conduct of the war against Hamas.\r\n\r\nThousands of people are expected to march for the second time this week through Sweden\u2019s third-largest city, which has a large Muslim population, to demand a boycott of Israel and a cease-fire in the seven-month war. In Finland, a group of about 40 protesters stormed the headquarters of public broadcaster YLE on Saturday morning, demanding it withdraw from the song contest because of Israel\u0027s participation.\r\n\r\nSeveral miles (kilometers) from central Malmo at the Malmo Arena, 25 acts \u2014 narrowed from 37 entrants by two semi-final runoffs \u2014 are due to perform three-minute songs in front of a live audience of thousands and an estimated 180 million viewers around the world.\r\n\r\nIt all makes for a messy climax to an event that draws both adoration and derision with its campy, kitschy ethos and passion for pop.\r\n\r\nDean Vuletic, an expert on the history of the contest, says that despite this year\u0027s divisions, \u201Cthere is no other cultural event which brings Europeans together quite like Eurovision does.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CJust this moment where everyone is watching the same television show, which is being broadcast live across 37 countries \u2014 that\u2019s something very special.\u201D\r\n\r\nThis year\u2019s entries range from emotional to eccentric. They include the goofy 1990s nostalgia of Finland\u2019s Windows95man, who emerges from a giant onstage egg wearing very little clothing. Ireland\u2019s Bambie Thug summons witchy spirits onstage and has brought a scream coach to Malmo, while Spain\u2019s Nebulossa boldly reclaims a term used as a slur on women in \u201CZorra.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe favorites include Swiss singer Nemo \u2014 who would be the first nonbinary Eurovision winner if their operatic song \u201CThe Code\u201D tops the voting \u2014 and Croatia\u2019s Baby Lasagna. His song \u201CRim Tim Tagi Dim\u201D is a rollicking rock number that tackles the issue of young Croatians leaving the country in search of a better life.\r\n\r\nVuletic says that despite the contest\u2019s reputation for disposable bubblegum pop, Eurovision often tackles \u201Cpolitical and social issues such as feminism, European integration, gender identity.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd I think they\u2019re the very interesting songs to look out for, especially because they\u2019re the most highly ranked by the bookies,\u201D he said.\r\n\r\nSometimes, though, songs run afoul of the contest\u2019s ban on openly \u201Cpolitical\u201D statements. Eurovision organizers told Israel to change the original title of its song, \u201COctober Rain\u201D \u2014 an apparent reference to the Oct. 7 Hamas attack that killed about 1,200 Israelis and triggered the Gaza war.\r\n\r\nIsraeli singer Eden Golan has shot up the odds since performing the power ballad, now titled \u201CHurricane,\u201D in Thursday\u2019s semifinal. Golan faced some booing at dress rehearsals, but was voted into the final by viewers around the world.\r\n\r\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised 20-year-old Golan for performing despite \u201Ccontending with an ugly wave of anti-Semitism.\u201D\r\n\r\nProtesters argue that Israel should not be allowed to take part amid a war that has killed almost 35,000 Palestinians.\r\n\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t think they should be a part of it at all because they are committing crimes against humanity,\u201D said local resident Lorenzo Mayr, who attended a demonstration on Thursday.\r\n\r\nThe competing musicians are feeling the pressure, inundated with messages and abuse on social media and unable to speak out because of the contest rules. Italy\u0027s contestant, Angelina Mango, made a statement by walking into the Eurovision media center on Friday and performing John Lennon\u0027s \u201CImagine\u201D as dozens of journalists gathered around her.\r\n\r\nSwedish singer Loreen, last year\u2019s Eurovision champion \u2014 and one of only two performers to win the contest twice \u2014 urged people not to shut down the \u201Ccommunity of love\u201D that is Eurovision.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat is happening in the world today and in different places is distorting and traumatizing all of us,\u201D she told The Associated Press.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat heals trauma \u2026. Does trauma heal trauma? Does negativity heal negativity? It doesn\u2019t work like that. The only thing that heals trauma for real \u2014 this is science \u2014 is love.\u201D","RSSSummary":"Hours before the Eurovision Song Contest final, Dutch contestant Joost Klein was booted out by organizers over a backstage incident.
