/* Firehose 2.0
 * Firehose is a News Data Aggregator, this is a complete rewrite.
 * Firehose's mission is to try and get every news article in real time.
 *
 * History of Firehose
 * Dec 2023 - Firehose 1.0
 * Under IAI, the concept of firehose was created.
 * Here it was written in python and the concept of firehose was proven.
 *
 * Jan/Fed 2024 Firehose 1.5
 * After IAI disappeared due to *reasons* Firehose was tweaked to
 * better serve news analysis instead of its original purpose.
 * It was also rewritten in C# with a few tweaks to make it run better,
 * this had major performance improvements compared to 1.0
 *
 * April 2024 Firehose 2.0
 * Firehose 2.0 is another rewrite of firehose to make the codebase more
 * professional and make further use of multi-threading to make sure we are
 * using 100% of the CPU at all times.
 *
 * Future Ideas:
 *  - Publisher information scraping
 *  - Author information scraping
